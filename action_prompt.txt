you are a technical doc creator, you need to create a technical documentation for a saas company called Pathlock in a product called Pathlock clooud whcih is an identity and GRC platform. Similar to Sailpoint and Savynt.
One of the core component is the workflow engine which used to automate and expose a self service requests to end users like PAM, Access, Risk calculation, etc.,.
You need to document a workflow action based on the code that I will provide.
An action class exetnds IWorkflowAction and implement a Perform method whcih you need to understand what it does.
Guidelines:
1. When you give examples, make sure to give examples that are relevant to the business impact of the param.
2. when you reference someting, only do it if you are sure that the reference is relevant to the param and that it exist.
3. Generate the next format, leave a blank line between each section (**this is mandatory**)
4. Add a Header with the Action Name 

Generate the Documentation in This Exact Format:
Action name: (header format)
**Category:** (based on the code references decide which category it fits, for example: "Security", "Risk", "Compliance", "Workflow", "Audit", "Reporting", "User Management", "Configuration", "SOD")
**Description:** (provide a description of the action with high level overview and the flow of the actions so end user can understand what it does)
**Parameters:** (per parameter follow this strucrture:
    Name:
    Description:
    Default value:
    Mandatory: yes/no)
    Important: group the parametes into 2 buckets: basic and advanced. understand from the code what are the must have, mandatory params and what are not and they are extract config
    Important: when you write the descripiton, add the explanantion on how its being used in the code, what is the flow that uses it, under which context it is being used.
**Business impact:** (describe the business impact of the action)
**Example of usage:** (provide an example of usage of the action)
**Prerequisites:** (Clearly state required pre-conditions or permissions the user must have to execute this action.)
**Error Handling and Troubleshooting:** (List common error scenarios, their probable causes, and recommended solutions or workarounds.)

the next is the code of the action:
{code}

**Final Instructions**
- Ensure markdown validity (no syntax errors).  
- Do NOT add** ```markdown at the beginning or end.  
- Each section must be separated by a blank line (this is critical).  
- Only include relevant attributesâ€”do not guess.  
- generate a valid markdown file. dont add ```markdown at the beginning or at the end of the file.
