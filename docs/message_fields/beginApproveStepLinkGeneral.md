**Field Name:** beginApproveStepLinkGeneral

**Description:** The `beginApproveStepLinkGeneral` field in email templates represents a placeholder for generating a generic approval link within a workflow process. This link is intended for recipients to approve a step in the workflow without specific restrictions, careful of its usage of universal attributes, and dynamic user-specific identifiers. The generic version excludes particular step IDs, allowing a more flexible or unrestricted approval action when rendered.

**Usage Context:** The `beginApproveStepLinkGeneral` field is typically used in email templates where a general approval link is needed without binding the link to a specific step ID. It is suited for workflows where the approval action doesn't need to reference a particular step, providing a broader application of the approval functionality. This placeholder is replaced with an actual hypertext link pointing to the general approval endpoint with dynamic query parameters.

**Example:**

    Approve directly: $$beginApproveStepLinkGeneral$$

    After rendering:

    Approve directly:  
    <a href="https://cloud.pathlock.com/approve?instanceGuid=<instance_guid>&Action=1&p2=<unique_identifier>&p3=<hashed_identifier>">Approve</a>
