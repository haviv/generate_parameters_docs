**Field Name:** beginApproveStepLinkThankYou

**Description:** The `beginApproveStepLinkThankYou` field is utilized in email templates to generate a hyperlink allowing the email recipient to approve a workflow step directly. This link, when clicked, will lead the recipient to an approval page, and will include a "Thank You" message upon successful approval.

**Usage Context:** This field is typically used in the context of workflow processes where an approver needs to verify and approve an action item. It is specifically employed in scenarios where the approval action is conditional on not needing further approval or processing.

**Example:**

    Approve here: $$beginApproveStepLinkThankYou$$

    After rendering:

    Approve here:
