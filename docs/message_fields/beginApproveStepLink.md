**Field Name:** beginApproveStepLink

**Description:** The `beginApproveStepLink` field is a placeholder used in email templates to provide a link for recipients to approve a step within a workflow. This link, when rendered, dynamically generates a URL that directs the user to the approval page for a specific step in the workflow process. The inclusion of query parameters ensures that the appropriate step and user context is considered when the link is created.

**Usage Context:** The `beginApproveStepLink` is typically used in email notifications sent during workflow processes where a recipient needs to take an approval action. This is commonly used in situations where a step in a workflow requires approval from a manager or group. The inclusion of this link in an email template ensures a streamlined approach for users to directly perform the necessary approval actions without needing to navigate manually through the system.
