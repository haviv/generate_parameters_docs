**Field Name:** adminName

**Description:** The `adminName` field represents the name of the workflow administrator. Its purpose is to personalize email templates by including the administrator's name, particularly in email notifications sent when there are no recipients specified and the email is sent to the workflow administrator as a fallback.

**Usage Context:** This field is typically used in email templates when there are no recipients available to receive an email notification related to a workflow process. In such cases, the email notification is directed to the workflow administrator, and the `adminName` is used to address the administrator within the message, maintaining a personal touch in the communication. 

**Example:**

    Admin Contact: $$adminName$$

    After rendering:

    Admin Contact: John Doe
