# Actions Address

**Technical Name:** Actions_Address  
**Category:** User Management  
**Default Value:** Not Specified  
**Impact Level:** Medium  
**Description:** This parameter is utilized to specify the email address or a list of email addresses for actions related to various user management tasks, security notifications, or compliance alerts within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform.  
**Business Impact:** Proper configuration of the "Actions Address" can ensure timely and effective communication with data owners or responsible parties for rapid response to security, compliance, or user role management issues. Misconfiguration might result in failure to notify the relevant stakeholders, potentially leading to unaddressed security risks or compliance violations.  
**Technical Impact when configured:** Enables the Pathlock GRC system to send out notifications or alerts related to specific events or violations to the configured email addresses. This can include notifications for security breaches, compliance issues, or user role changes that require attention or action from a designated data owner or administrator.  
**Example Scenario:** If a user's action violates a predefined compliance rule within the Pathlock environment, the system can automatically send an alert to the email address specified in the Actions_Address parameter, allowing for immediate follow-up and remedial action.

- **Configure when:** it's critical to ensure real-time notifications for security breaches, compliance violations, or critical user management events. Provide a list of email addresses that are regularly monitored by your IT security, compliance, or user management teams.
- **Avoid when:** using generic or non-monitored email addresses, as this could lead to missed notifications and unaddressed issues within the Pathlock environment.

**Context:**  
The Actions_Address parameter is crucial for managing real-time alerting and notifications within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It plays a significant role in security, compliance, and user management by ensuring that relevant stakeholders are immediately informed about any issues requiring their attention. While the code references do not explicitly mention Actions_Address, they hint at a system designed with detailed user and system settings management, including notification mechanisms. Proper configuration of this parameter can help organizations maintain compliance, manage security risks, and efficiently address user management issues.
