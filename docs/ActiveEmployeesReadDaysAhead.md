# Active Employees Read Days Ahead

**Technical Name:** ActiveEmployeesReadDaysAhead

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** *The default value is not explicitly mentioned in the provided references, so you might need to check the system or product documentation for this detail.*

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** This parameter determines how many days ahead of the current date the system should consider when reading active employee data from the organization's ERP system, specifically in the context of SAP HCM (Human Capital Management). It is used to pre-fetch employee data to streamline operations and ensure timely access to relevant employee information.

**Business Impact:** Configuring this parameter appropriately can enhance workforce planning and management by ensuring that decision-makers and processes have access to the most relevant and up-to-date employee data. It can also impact how future-dated changes in the organization structure, such as promotions or transfers, are handled, potentially improving compliance and audit readiness by accurately reflecting upcoming organizational changes.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When configured, this parameter will directly influence the volume of data the system processes during synchronization tasks with the SAP ERP system. Setting a larger number of days can increase the amount of data processed and may impact system performance, whereas a smaller number might limit visibility into future changes in employee status.

**Example Scenario:** If your organization frequently makes future-dated changes in the SAP HCM system, such as scheduled promotions or department transfers that are decided in advance, setting this parameter to a higher value ensures these changes are captured and reflected in the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform ahead of time. This can be crucial for compliance reporting, access rights management, and risk assessment workflows that require foresight into organizational changes.

**Related Settings:** SoDImpactAnalysisCalculator_MinimumRiskLevel - While not directly related, understanding the minimum risk level setting can help in configuring the Active Employees Read Days Ahead parameter by aligning data synchronization strategies with risk management objectives.

**Applicable Workflows Actions:** Not explicitly mentioned in the context provided.

**Best Practices:**
- **Configure when:** Your organization has dynamic workforce management practices with frequent future-dated organizational changes in SAP HCM. Knowing about these changes in advance can help in planning and compliance.
- **Avoid when:** The organization rarely makes future-dated changes or if the system's performance is a concern. In such cases, a minimal value is preferable to maintain efficiency.

**Context:** This parameter plays a critical role in ensuring that the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform remains synchronized with the organization's ERP system, specifically SAP HCM, for the most current and upcoming employee data. This synchronization helps in various GRC processes, including but not limited to compliance monitoring, risk management, and audit trails.
