## Category
- Security/Authorization

## Default Value
- `False`

## Impact Level
- Application Behavior Modification

## Description
The `AuthorizationCertificationForReportPushApprovalsToReport` parameter is a configuration setting that controls whether approval data keys are stored and pushed to reports during the authorization certification process. When enabled, the system captures approval decisions made during the review processes, stores them, and then includes this data within designated reports. This feature is particularly useful for audit trails, compliance reporting, and enhancing transparency in the approval process.

## Business Impact
Enabling this setting ensures that decision-making during the authorization certification process is fully documented and reportable. This can aid organizations in meeting compliance requirements and provides an audit trail that can be reviewed for accuracy, fraud detection, and regulatory compliance.

## Technical Impact when configured
- With this setting enabled, every approval made during the authorization certification process is recorded.
- The system generates and maintains a dictionary of approval data keys, which are then pushed to reports.
- It may increase the database and report generation load due to the additional data being processed and stored.
- Enhances the detail level of reports related to authorization certification processes.

## Examples Scenario
- **Compliance Reporting:** In environments where tracking every approval decision is crucial for compliance reasons, enabling this setting will ensure that the necessary data is captured and made reportable.
- **Audit Reviews:** To prepare for internal or external audits, organizations may enable this setting to have detailed reports showing approval flows and decisions within the certification process.

## Related Settings
- `ReviewElement` and `OriginalReportName` settings impact this parameter, as approvals are tied to specific review elements and reports.

## Best Practices
- **Configure when:** There is a need for detailed reporting on approval decisions for compliance or auditing purposes.
- **Avoid when:** The additional data storage and processing load is a concern, and there is no substantive requirement for detailed approval reporting.

## Context
The parameter is a part of the PathlockGRC suite and interacts closely with the authorization certification process, storing approvals made during the review stages and pushing this data to relevant reports. This process ensures that organizations can maintain and demonstrate a comprehensive audit trail of decision-making activities related to access and authorization.
