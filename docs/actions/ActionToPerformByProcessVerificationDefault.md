# ActionToPerformByProcessVerificationDefault

**Category:** Workflow

**Description:** The `ActionToPerformByProcessVerificationDefault` is a core workflow action designed to automate the process of verification within the Pathlock Cloud identity and GRC platform. This action plays a critical role in ensuring that specific verification steps are completed as part of a broader, automated workflow. Its primary function is to evaluate and verify various processes in a predefined manner, ensuring that each process meets the necessary criteria established by the organization's policies. 

The action performs an automated verification check without much detail provided on the specifics of the verification logic. As such, it can be inferred that the implementation details are to be customized based on the specific needs of a process verification step. The action operates within the context of a workflow engine where it is executed as a part of a series of actions aimed at managing access, risk calculation, privilege management (PAM), and more, offering a self-service approach for end-users.

**Parameters:**

_Basic:_
- Since no parameters are specifically defined or utilized in the code snippet provided, it cannot be accurately detailed. Typically, parameters such as **ProcessID** or **VerificationType** could be expected as mandatory to specify which process is being verified and the nature of the verification.

_Advanced:_ 
- Advanced parameters would typically include configurations for logging, notification thresholds, or custom verification logic plugin names but are not detailed in the provided code snippet.

**Business impact:** This action is fundamental in automating and enforcing compliance and governance measures within the organization. By automating the process verification, Pathlock Cloud ensures that only verified processes proceed further in the workflow, minimizing the risk associated with manual errors and oversight. It supports compliance with internal policies and external regulations by providing a consistent and reliable mechanism for process verification.

**Example of usage:**
```csharp
// Note: This is a hypothetical example due to the lack of detailed information on parameters and implementation specifics.
WorkflowActionPramaters verificationParams = new WorkflowActionPramaters();
verificationParams.Add("ProcessID", "12345");
verificationParams.Add("VerificationType", "ComplianceCheck");

ActionToPerformByProcessVerificationDefault verificationAction = new ActionToPerformByProcessVerificationDefault();
verificationAction.Perform(verificationParams);
```

**Prerequisites:**
- User must have permission to execute workflow actions within the Pathlock Cloud platform.
- There must be a predefined process and criteria available for verification.
- The workflow engine should be properly configured to support custom actions.

**Error Handling and Troubleshooting:**

_Common Error Scenarios:_
1. **Insufficient Permissions:** The user does not have the required permissions to execute the action.
   - **Solution:** Ensure the user executing the action has the appropriate permissions set within Pathlock Cloud's User Management settings.
   
2. **Undefined Parameters:** The action is executed without the required parameters or context.
   - **Solution:** Verify that all mandatory parameters are passed correctly in the `WorkflowActionPramaters` object before calling the `Perform` method.

In cases where error descriptions are vague or the action fails silently, logs should be thoroughly reviewed within the Pathlock Cloud's logging framework. Contact support for further assistance if the issue persists.
