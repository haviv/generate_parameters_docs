# ActionToPerformByProcessVerificationDefault

**Category:** Workflow

**Description:** The `ActionToPerformByProcessVerificationDefault` action is designed to be a core component within the Pathlock cloud's workflow engine. It plays a crucial role in automating processes and facilitating the exposure of self-service requests to end-users. This action, though not explicitly detailed in the provided code, typically involves running checks or processes necessary for verifying certain conditions or states within the system. By assuming a default behavior for process verification, it aims to ensure consistency and reliability in executing tasks such as Privileged Access Management (PAM), access requests, and risk calculation workflows.

**Parameters:**
*Basic Parameters:*
- There are no specific parameters detailed in the provided code snippet, which suggests that this action might utilize a standard set of parameters inherited or assumed by the `IWorkflowAction` interface.

*Advanced Parameters:*
- The provided code does not outline advanced parameters, emphasizing the action's role as a foundational, default operation within the workflow engine.

**Business impact:** Implementing the `ActionToPerformByProcessVerificationDefault` within workflows significantly contributes to operational efficiency and security compliance. For businesses, especially those dealing with sensitive information or requiring strict access controls, this action automates the verification processes that are critical for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the system. By standardizing this process, companies can reduce manual errors, ensure compliance with internal and external regulations, and streamline user access management.

**Example of usage:** In a typical scenario where a new employee requires access to certain resources, the `ActionToPerformByProcessVerificationDefault` could be invoked as part of a workflow to automatically verify the employee's eligibility based on predefined criteria. This may include checking departmental assignments, job roles, or completion of mandatory compliance training.

**Prerequisites:** Users or systems attempting to execute this action must have appropriate permissions set within the Pathlock cloud platform, aligning with the governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) policies established by the organization. For instance, initiating this action might require admin-level permissions or specific roles within the workflow management framework.

**Error Handling and Troubleshooting:** 
- *Common Error Scenario:* Failure to initiate the process verification due to insufficient permissions.
  - *Probable Cause:* The user or service account does not have the necessary roles or permissions to execute the action.
  - *Recommended Solution:* Verify the user's permissions and role assignments within the Pathlock cloud platform. Ensure that the account has been granted the necessary privileges to perform workflow actions.

- *Common Error Scenario:* The process verification does not complete or returns an unexpected result.
  - *Probable Cause:* There may be issues with the workflow's configuration, such as incorrect parameters or a misconfigured environment.
  - *Recommended Solution:* Review the workflow configuration and ensure that all necessary conditions and parameters are correctly defined and applied. Check the system logs for any detailed error messages that can aid in diagnosing the issue.
