Action Name: ReleaseTransport

**Category:** Workflow

**Description:** 
The `ReleaseTransport` action is designed to automate the process of releasing a transport request within a system, specifically oriented towards SAP environments. This action enables the integration into workflows where automated deployment or migration processes are essential. When executed, `ReleaseTransport` leverages the existing SAP connection to release a specified transport request by its ID. This functionality is crucial for environments where transports need to be managed programmatically, facilitating seamless transitions between development, testing, and production stages.

**Parameters:** 
- Basic:
    - Name: TransportNo
    - Description: This is the ID of the transport request to be released. In the context of SAP, transport requests are used to move configuration changes and developments from one system to another.
    - Default value: None
    - Mandatory: yes

    
- Advanced:
    - Name: NewRoleName
    - Description: Although not directly used within the current implementation of `ReleaseTransport`, this parameter suggests a scaffold for future expansions where a new role name could be associated with the transport process, potentially to define new permissions or settings post-transport.
    - Default value: None
    - Mandatory: no

**Business impact:** 
Utilizing the `ReleaseTransport` action within the Pathlock cloud platform enables businesses to automate critical parts of their system deployment processes, significantly reducing the manual effort and potential errors associated with these operations. This ensures that system updates, critical security patches, or configuration changes can be deployed efficiently and reliably, thereby maintaining the integrity and security posture of the SAP ecosystem.

**Example of usage:** 
A typical scenario for using the `ReleaseTransport` action could involve automating the deployment of a new feature developed in the SAP sandbox environment to a production environment. Administrators can configure a workflow that, upon successful testing, automatically triggers the `ReleaseTransport` action to move the changes to production, reducing the downtime and manual intervention required.

**Prerequisites:** 
Users must have the necessary permissions to perform transport requests within the target SAP system. Additionally, the system ID provided must correspond to a configured and accessible SAP connection within the Pathlock platform.

**Error Handling and Troubleshooting:** 
- Error: Transport request not found.
    - Cause: The specified `TransportNo` does not exist or is incorrect.
    - Solution: Verify the transport request ID and ensure it is correct and exists within the target system.
- Error: SAP Connection Failure.
    - Cause: The system could not establish a connection to the SAP system, possibly due to incorrect system ID or network issues.
    - Solution: Check the system ID used in the parameters to ensure it corresponds to a correctly configured SAP system within the Pathlock platform. Additionally, verify network connectivity and configurations.
- Warning: Unused Parameter `NewRoleName`.
    - Cause: The action currently does not utilize the `NewRoleName` parameter.
    - Solution: No immediate action required. This parameter is reserved for future use and does not impact the current operation of the action.
