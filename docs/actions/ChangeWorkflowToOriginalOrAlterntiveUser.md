Action Name: ChangeWorkflowToOriginalOrAlternativeUser

**Category:** User Management

**Description:** This action facilitates the dynamic reassignment of workflow ownership based on alternative user specifications or reversion to the original user. It examines the current state of a workflow instance and determines whether to switch the assigned user to an alternative specified one or revert back to the originally assigned user. This is particularly useful in scenarios where temporary delegation or reassignment of duties is necessary, such as during periods of absence or when specific expertise is required for certain workflow stages. The action accesses user information from a database, checks the validity of user IDs, and updates the workflow instance's user accordingly.

**Parameters:**  
_Basic:_  
- Name: AlternativeWorkflowUser  
  Description: This parameter specifies an alternative username to which the workflow should be reassigned. If provided and valid, the workflow's associated user will be changed to this user. The action searches for a user with a matching 'SapUserName' within the same system as the originally assigned user and updates the workflow instance if found. It's used to dynamically alter workflow responsibility without altering the original configuration permanently.  
  Default value: None  
  Mandatory: No  

_Advanced:_  
- No advanced parameters are specified for this action.

**Business impact:** Implementing this action can significantly enhance operational flexibility and efficiency. It allows for seamless transitions of responsibilities between users, ensuring that workflow processes are not stalled due to user unavailability. This adaptability is critical in maintaining uninterrupted workflow progress in dynamic or rapidly changing business environments, thereby minimizing delays and potential impacts on service delivery, compliance, and risk management processes.

**Example of usage:** A common scenario for using this action would be in a leave management workflow, where an employee responsible for a critical approval will be absent. By setting the 'AlternativeWorkflowUser', the workflow can be temporally reassigned to a stand-in employee, ensuring continuous progress of the workflow activities without delay.

**Prerequisites:** To successfully execute this action, the following conditions must be met:
- The workflow instance must be active and associated with a valid user.
- For reassignment, the specified 'AlternativeWorkflowUser' must exist in the system and be associated with the same 'SystemId' as the original user.
- Proper permissions must be in place to allow reassignment of workflow users.

**Error Handling and Troubleshooting:**  
- If the 'AlternativeWorkflowUser' is specified but not found in the database, the action will not modify the workflow's assigned user. Ensure the correct 'SapUserName' is provided.
- Attempting to revert to the original user without a valid 'OriginalUserId' present in the request data will fail, logging an error regarding the invalid original user ID value. Ensure that the 'OriginalUserId' is correctly populated and valid.
- Common errors include database access issues or permissions errors when attempting to update the workflow user. Verify database connectivity and that the executing account has sufficient privileges.
