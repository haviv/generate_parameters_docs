## FixRoleMenu

**Category:** Configuration

**Description:** 

The `FixRoleMenu` action is designed to update the role menu configuration within the Pathlock Cloud platform, particularly focusing on scenarios where roles might have been modified or require a refresh to ensure that access permissions are accurately reflected in user interfaces and audit reports. This action is initiated through the workflow engine, where it leverages the `ProfileTailorContext` to interact with system connectors, specifically targeting role authorization changes. The primary flow involves fetching the specified role name from the workflow parameters, and based on this role name, it triggers an update action to rebuild the role menu. This ensures that any changes in role definitions are properly applied across the system interfaces.

**Parameters:**

- Basic
  - Name: RoleName
    Description: The name of the role for which the menu is to be fixed or updated. This parameter is utilized to fetch the specific role's current settings and trigger the menu rebuild process. It is fundamental in identifying the exact role that requires updates within the system's role management framework.
    Default value: N/A
    Mandatory: yes

- Advanced
  - No advanced parameters are used in this action.

**Business impact:** 

Executing the `FixRoleMenu` action directly influences the system's security posture and operational efficiency by ensuring role definitions are current and accurately reflected in the system's user interface. This is crucial for maintaining proper access controls and compliance with internal and external audit requirements. An updated role menu aids in preventing unauthorized access and enhances the overall user experience by ensuring that users have access to the necessary resources and functionalities according to their permissions.

**Example of usage:** 

If a system administrator notices that changes made to a role, such as permissions adjustments or assigned resources, are not reflected in the user interfaces or reports, they may use the `FixRoleMenu` action to rectify this issue. By providing the name of the affected role as a parameter, the system will ensure that all menus and access rights associated with this role are correctly rebuilt and displayed, reinforcing the integrity of role-based access controls.

**Prerequisites:** 

- The user must have administrative access to execute workflow actions within the Pathlock Cloud platform.
- The specified role name must exist within the system's role management database.

**Error Handling and Troubleshooting:** 

- **Error:** "Role name not found."
  - **Cause:** The specified role name does not exist in the system database.
  - **Solution:** Verify the role name for accuracy and ensure it matches the intended role's name exactly as it exists in the system.

- **Error:** "Failed to initiate role menu rebuild."
  - **Cause:** The system encountered an issue accessing the role's current configuration or interfacing with the role management subsystem.
  - **Solution:** Check the system's connectivity and ensure the ProfileTailorContext and system connectors are correctly configured and operational. If the issue persists, consult system logs for more detailed error messages and engage the platform support team.
