Action Name: FillFormAction

**Category:** Workflow

**Description:** 

The `FillFormAction` class is designed to facilitate the automation of filling forms within the Pathlock Cloud platform, primarily focusing on operations related to identity, access, and compliance workflows. When executed, this action retrieves a specific workflow action instance, identifies the relevant UI screens associated with this action, and generates XML instructions based on the action's requirements and the data present in the identified screens. It concludes by submitting these changes to the database for processing and further action.

**Parameters:**

*Basic:*

- Name: WorkflowActionToPerformId
    - Description: Identifies the specific instance of the workflow action to be performed. It is used to fetch the associated workflow action instance and its related UI screen(s) for processing.
    - Default value: N/A
    - Mandatory: Yes

*Advanced:*

N/A

**Business impact:**

Implementing `FillFormAction` in workflow automations significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of processing form-related tasks within Pathlock Cloud. For identity and access management (IAM), governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) activities, this action minimizes manual intervention, thereby reducing errors, speeding up request handling, and ensuring compliance through automated adherence to defined policies.

**Example of usage:**

To execute a `FillFormAction` within a workflow, you would configure a workflow step with the `FillFormAction` class and specify the WorkflowActionToPerformId parameter within the workflow definition. This setup enables the automated filling of forms for self-service requests such as privileged access management (PAM) setup, access request processing, or risk calculation submissions.

**Prerequisites:**

1. Users or systems attempting to execute this action must have appropriate permissions to access and modify workflow actions and associated UI screens within the Pathlock Cloud platform.
2. The specific workflow action identified by `WorkflowActionToPerformId` must exist and be accessible within the workflow management system.

**Error Handling and Troubleshooting:**

- **Error Scenario 1:** WorkflowActionToPerformId does not correspond to any existing workflow action instance.
    - **Probable Cause:** Incorrect or outdated ID provided.
    - **Recommended Solution:** Verify the WorkflowActionToPerformId against the current list of workflow actions in the system.

- **Error Scenario 2:** Failure in submitting changes to the database.
    - **Probable Cause:** Database access issues or constraints violations.
    - **Recommended Solution:** Check database connectivity and integrity constraints related to workflow actions and UI screens. Ensure that the system has adequate permissions to make changes to the database.
