# Action name: CloseToServiceNowTicket

**Category:** Workflow

**Description:** 
The `CloseToServiceNowTicket` action is designed to facilitate the automated closure of tickets in ServiceNow. When performed, this action leverages the ServiceNow API to update the status of a specified ticket to "Closed". This is primarily achieved by extracting the ticket number from the parameters provided, sending a closure comment (if any), and utilizing the ServiceNowProvider's `CloseTicket` method to officially close the ticket in the ServiceNow system.

**Parameters:** 
- Basic:
  - Name: TicketNumber
    Description: The unique identifier of the ticket within ServiceNow that needs to be closed. This parameter is used to specify the exact ticket to close in the workflow.
    Default value: N/A
    Mandatory: yes
  - Name: CloseComment
    Description: A comment that can be optionally added to the ticket upon closure. It serves as a note or reason for the ticket's closure.
    Default value: N/A (optional)
    Mandatory: no

**Business impact:** 
Closing tickets promptly and accurately within ServiceNow is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency, compliance, and a clear audit trail. This action helps in automating the closure process, thereby reducing manual effort, minimizing errors, and ensuring timely updates. It particularly impacts areas such as IT service management (ITSM), incident management, and requirement fulfillment processes by streamlining the final step of the service lifecycle.

**Example of usage:** 
In a scenario where an IT issue has been resolved, and it's time to close the associated ServiceNow ticket, the `CloseToServiceNowTicket` action can be triggered as part of the workflow. The workflow would extract the unique ticket number and send a closure command with an optional comment such as "Issue resolved and verified by user."

**Prerequisites:** 
The user or automated system intending to execute this action must have:
- Sufficient permissions within the target ServiceNow instance to update ticket statuses.
- Credentials for the ServiceNowProvider configured in the `CommonSettings` (HelpDeskSystemUrl, HelpDeskSystemUser, HelpDeskSystemPassword).

**Error Handling and Troubleshooting:** 
- **Common Error Scenario:** Failure to close the ticket due to incorrect TicketNumber.
  - **Probable Cause:** The ticket number provided does not exist or was entered incorrectly.
  - **Solution:** Verify that the ticket number exists in ServiceNow and is accurate.
  
- **Common Error Scenario:** Authentication failure with ServiceNow.
  - **Probable Cause:** ServiceNow credentials (user/password) in `CommonSettings` are incorrect or have expired.
  - **Solution:** Revalidate the ServiceNow credentials and update `CommonSettings` accordingly.

- **Common Error Scenario:** Network or API issues when connecting to ServiceNow.
  - **Probable Cause:** Network connectivity problems or ServiceNow API service disruptions.
  - **Solution:** Check for network issues from the executing system to ServiceNow and verify if ServiceNow's API is operational. If it's a temporary issue with ServiceNow, retry after some time.
