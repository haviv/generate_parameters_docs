# FFAutoLoginAction

**Category:** User Management

**Description:** 

The `FFAutoLoginAction` class is designed to automate the process of changing a user's initial password to a new one in the SAP environment, facilitating automatic login capabilities. This action begins by initializing the ProfileTailor context based on the user's system ID, followed by generating temporary and new password values. It attempts to set the initial password for the user; if successful, it proceeds to change the password to a new production-ready password. The action then compiles and prepares a SAP GUI executable with necessary parameters for auto-login, and creates a download link for the user. This automation streamlines the process of password management and ensures secure access controls are maintained.

**Parameters:**

- Basic:
  - Name: Sysname
    - Description: Specifies the system name in SAP GUI to which the connection is established.
    - Default value: Derived from the `UserProfileTailorSystem.FriendlyDescription` if not explicitly provided.
    - Mandatory: No
  - Name: WorkflowCompletedFileDownloadFileName
    - Description: The filename for the executable that will be downloaded by the user upon completion of the workflow.
    - Default value: "download.exe" if not specified.
    - Mandatory: No

- Advanced:
  - Name: Logon_Language
    - Description: Determines the language for the SAP GUI logon screen. Used in configuring the SAP GUI template.
    - Default value: "EN"
    - Mandatory: No

**Business impact:** 

The `FFAutoLoginAction` directly influences how quickly and securely users can gain access to necessary systems without direct IT intervention. Automating the password reset and SAP GUI configuration processes reduces administrative overhead, enhances security by ensuring passwords are changed according to policy, and improves user experience by minimizing downtime. This functionality is crucial for businesses where timely access to systems is directly tied to operational efficiency and security compliance.

**Example of usage:** 

This action is triggered as part of an automated workflow when a user requires their SAP system password to be reset. Upon detecting a password reset request, the `FFAutoLoginAction` is executed, performing the initial password change, followed by the setting of a new production password. Finally, it prepares and provides an executable for the user, through which they can automatically log into the SAP system without manual password entry.

**Prerequisites:** 

- The user must exist in the ProfileTailor system with a valid system ID.
- SAP GUI must be installed on the client machine where the action's output executable will be run.
- The executing environment must have permissions to access and modify user credentials within the SAP system.

**Error Handling and Troubleshooting:** 

- Failure in changing the initial password: Check if the user exists and verify connectivity with the ProfileTailor system. Ensure the ProfileTailor context has been initialized correctly.
- Failure in compiling the SAP GUI executable: Ensure that the code template is correctly formatted and all required parameters have been supplied.
- Download link not generated: Verify that the session state is accessible and that the correct parameters are being passed for generating the post-run URL.

Common errors include connection issues with the SAP system or problems with the template syntax. Log files and the detailed error messages captured during exception handling should be the first step in diagnosing any issues encountered during execution.
