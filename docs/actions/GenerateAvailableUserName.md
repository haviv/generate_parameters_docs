Action Name: GenerateAvailableUserName

**Category:** User Management

**Description:**

The `GenerateAvailableUserName` action is a part of the User Creation Management module that automates the creation, activation, or termination of user accounts across various systems. It leverages the workflow engine to handle user name generation based on predefined rules and conditions. The action iterates over systems to find an appropriate username, checking for availability and conforming to system-specific requirements. It supports the notion of using a single username across different systems or generating distinct usernames per system. Upon successful determination, the action crafts a message, optionally formatted with a provided template, informing about the generated, activated, or terminated username.

**Parameters:**

- Basic:
    - Name: CreatedUsernameMessageToUserTemplate
    - Description: Template for the message to be sent to the user regarding their new username. This template can include placeholders for dynamic substitution.
    - Default value: None
    - Mandatory: No

- Advanced:
    - Additional parameters retrieved from `GetScreenAndAdditionalParameters` method are considered advanced. These could include system-specific customization options that are not critical for the action's primary operation but allow for greater control and personalization.

**Business impact:**

This action streamlines the user onboarding process, significantly reducing the manual effort and time required to assign usernames across different systems. By ensuring that usernames are generated in compliance with system and organizational policies, it mitigates the risk of access issues or conflicts. Automating this process also enhances the user experience by quickly providing access credentials, allowing new or updated users to commence their tasks without unnecessary delay.

**Example of usage:**

To use the `GenerateAvailableUserName` action, a workflow could be initiated as part of the new user onboarding process. When a new employee is added to the HR system, the workflow is triggered, calling this action to generate a valid username across all necessary systems. For example, if the template message is “Welcome, your new username is: {0}”, and a username ‘john.doe’ is generated, the user will receive a message stating: “Welcome, your new username is: john.doe”.

**Prerequisites:**

- The workflow system should be properly configured and connected to the target systems (e.g., SAP, Active Directory) for user management actions.
- Necessary permissions to create, activate, or terminate user accounts in the target systems.
- (If applicable) A template message for user notification should be prepared in advance.

**Error Handling and Troubleshooting:**

- **Error:** Username generation fails for all tried systems.
    - **Cause:** System connectivity issues, or no available usernames conforming to the rules.
    - **Solution:** Verify system connections and username policies. Consider overriding system-specific rules if appropriate.

- **Error:** Message template formatting fails.
    - **Cause:** Incorrectly formatted template string.
    - **Solution:** Ensure that the template string uses correct placeholders and syntax for dynamic content substitution.

Remember to monitor the workflow engine’s logs for any unexpected exceptions or warnings during the execution of this action, and consult the system documentation for troubleshooting guides specific to the target systems involved.
