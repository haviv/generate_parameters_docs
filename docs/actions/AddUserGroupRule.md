Action Name: AddUserGroupRule

**Category:** User Management

**Description:** The `AddUserGroupRule` action is responsible for adding a user to a specific group based on predefined conditions. It first extracts the name of the user group and the username from the workflow action parameters. If either of these parameters is missing, the action halts to avoid processing incomplete data. The core logic builds a dynamic query based on the username, which is then used to create a new user group condition in the database. This user group condition contains the compiled query, a definition, and an XML definition that outlines the user's membership in the group. The action interacts with a database context to add the new rule and commit changes.

**Parameters:**
- Basic:
  - Name: AssignUserGroup
    - Description: The name of the user group to which the user will be added. This parameter is used to locate the group ID in the database, which is a critical step in linking the user to the correct group.
    - Default value: N/A
    - Mandatory: Yes
    
  - Name: ADUserName
    - Description: The Active Directory username of the user. This parameter is crucial for building the correct condition to associate the user with the group. It forms part of the dynamic query to ensure the user is matched accurately in the database.
    - Default value: N/A
    - Mandatory: Yes

**Business impact:** Automating the process of adding users to specific groups based on dynamic criteria significantly eases user management tasks, particularly in large or rapidly changing environments. By ensuring users are correctly assigned to groups, organizations can streamline access management, improve security, and ensure compliance with internal or regulatory requirements.

**Example of usage:** Suppose an organization needs to automatically add new employees to a "NewHires" group based on their Active Directory username. By utilizing the `AddUserGroupRule` action within a workflow, HR or IT personnel can ensure that as soon as a new employee's username is entered into the system, a rule is automatically created and applied to add them to the appropriate group, without manual intervention.

**Prerequisites:** Users must have permission to execute database operations and access specific user groups and user details within the Active Directory system. Adequate permissions are required to interact with the ProfileTailorDataClassesDataContext or equivalent database context and make changes.

**Error Handling and Troubleshooting:** 
- If the action fails to add a user to a group, verify that both the user group name and the AD username parameters are correctly supplied and accurate. 
- Ensure the database context is accessible and that the executing user has the necessary permissions to make changes.
- If the compiled query does not correctly identify the user, check the syntax and logic used in the `BuildCondition` method to ensure it aligns with the database schema and user data format.
- System logs and exceptions should be monitored for any errors thrown during the execution of this action, providing insights into possible data or connectivity issues.
