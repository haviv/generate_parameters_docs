Implementing this action in your workflow significantly enhances security and compliance postures by ensuring regular and systematic reviews of user access rights.

**Example of usage:** 

To use this action in a workflow, define it as part of your sequence when setting up or updating authorization review processes. For instance, as part of a quarterly compliance check, configure the workflow to trigger this action, specifying whether to notify approvers based on the organizationâ€™s policies for the current review cycle.

**Prerequisites:** 

Users must have appropriate permissions to initiate authorization reviews and to execute workflow actions. Additionally, a valid system identifier (SystemId) and template for the authorization review process must be pre-defined in the system.

**Error Handling and Troubleshooting:** 

- **Error:** "No review created" 
    - **Cause:** This error may occur if the action is unable to create a new authorization review record in the database.
    - **Solution:** Check the database connectivity and permissions. Ensure that the `SystemId` is correct and refers to an existing system in your organization.

Common issues may involve configuration errors or missing parameters. Review the workflow configuration and ensure all mandatory parameters are correctly set. For connectivity issues, verify the database server status and network configurations.
