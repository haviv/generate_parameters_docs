Action Name: MyManagerAction

**Category:** Workflow

**Description:** The MyManagerAction is designed as part of Pathlock Cloud's workflow engine, focusing on automating and managing tasks within the platform. This action serves as a coordinator for initiating other actions within a workflow process, making it a crucial component in the execution of automated tasks such as Privileged Access Management (PAM), access requests, and risk calculations. When executed, it retrieves specific parameters provided by the end user or system, uses these parameters to initiate another action (in the provided example, an EchoAction), and finally, executes any awaiting actions in the workflow queue. This flow allows for dynamic and adaptable workflow management based on real-time user or system input.

**Parameters:**

Basic:
- Name: MyValue
  - Description: Used as a key to retrieve specific value from the workflow parameters. This value often determines the behavior of subsequent actions within the workflow, such as identifying a target resource or action to be managed.
  - Default value: N/A
  - Mandatory: Yes

**Business impact:** By enabling an action like MyManagerAction within Pathlock Cloud, businesses can automate complex processes involving multiple steps or conditions based on the context provided by 'MyValue'. This not only streamlines operations by reducing manual effort but also enforces consistency and minimizes the risk of errors in critical processes such as access management or compliance checks. It directly contributes to improved efficiency, security posture, and compliance adherence by ensuring that actions are taken based on up-to-date and relevant information.

**Example of usage:** A typical use case might involve automating the process of user access review. When a request for access review comes in, MyManagerAction could be configured to fetch the review parameters (such as user ID or access level) and use these parameters to initiate a series of actions, starting with EchoAction to log or notify stakeholders, followed by further actions to collect, analyze, and report on access privileges.

**Prerequisites:** The user or system initiating MyManagerAction must have the necessary permissions to execute workflow actions within the Pathlock Cloud platform. Additionally, the specific parameters ('MyValue' in this case) needed by the action must be defined and accessible within the workflow context.

**Error Handling and Troubleshooting:**

- **Error:** "Parameter 'MyValue' not found"
  - **Cause:** The action was executed without the necessary 'MyValue' parameter being passed or defined in the workflow context.
  - **Solution:** Ensure that all required parameters are correctly passed to the workflow action before execution. Review the workflow configuration to confirm that 'MyValue' is included and properly defined.

- **Error:** "Failed to initiate EchoAction"
  - **Cause:** There could be a misconfiguration in the EchoAction setup or an issue with the workflow engine's ability to initiate actions.
  - **Solution:** Verify the configuration of EchoAction and check that the workflow engine is functioning correctly. Review logs for more detailed error messages and ensure that there are no underlying issues with the action classes or workflow system.
