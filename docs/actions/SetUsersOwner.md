Action Name: SetUsersOwner

**Category:** User Management

**Description:** The `SetUsersOwner` action is designed to assign an ownership to a specific user within the Pathlock Cloud platform. This action automates the process of defining or updating the owner of a user account, leveraging the workflow engine to facilitate self-service requests and streamline access management. The action determines if a user owner parameter is provided and sets the ownership accordingly; if no parameter is specified, it defaults to the user who initiated the workflow. This functionality is crucial for maintaining accurate record-keeping of user ownership and ensuring accountability within the organization's identity and access management practices.

**Parameters:**

  Basic:
  - Name: UserOwner
    Description: Specifies the owner to be assigned to the user. If provided, this parameter overrides the default owner (the user initiating the workflow). This parameter is utilized to explicitly define or change who has ownership over a specific user account, allowing for flexibility in managing user account details within the system.
    Default value: N/A
    Mandatory: No

**Business impact:** The efficient management of user account ownership has direct implications for security, compliance, and operational integrity within an organization. By automating the assignment of user owners, the `SetUsersOwner` action reduces manual errors, enhances the speed of access management processes, and supports a clear delineation of responsibilities. This is particularly valuable in contexts where user ownership is a critical component of access reviews, audit trails, and compliance reporting.

**Example of usage:** Suppose an organization requires a change in the ownership of a user account due to department reassignment or personnel changes. An administrator can initiate a workflow using the `SetUsersOwner` action, specifying the new owner through the `UserOwner` parameter. This action ensures the user account is promptly updated to reflect the new ownership, maintaining the accuracy of user management records and supporting internal auditing procedures.

**Prerequisites:** To successfully execute the `SetUsersOwner` action, the user must have appropriate permissions to initiate workflows and make changes to user account details within the Pathlock Cloud platform. Additionally, the specified `UserOwner` (if provided) must be a valid user within the system.

**Error Handling and Troubleshooting:**

- Common Error: "Invalid UserOwner Parameter"
  - Probable Cause: The specified `UserOwner` does not exist or is incorrectly formatted.
  - Recommended Solution: Verify that the `UserOwner` parameter is correct and corresponds to an existing user. Ensure the input is formatted correctly according to the system's requirements.

- Common Error: "Unauthorized Action"
  - Probable Cause: The user attempting to execute the action lacks the necessary permissions to alter user ownership details.
  - Recommended Solution: Ensure the user has the appropriate permissions to perform the action. Review the platform's access control settings and update the user's permissions as needed.

By clearly defining user ownership and facilitating its management within the Pathlock Cloud platform, organizations can enhance their security posture, ensure regulatory compliance, and streamline their operational processes.
