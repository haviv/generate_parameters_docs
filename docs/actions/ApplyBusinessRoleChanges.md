# ApplyBusinessRoleChanges

**Category:** User Management

**Description:** 

The `ApplyBusinessRoleChanges` action is designed to manage business role modifications in the Pathlock Cloud platform. This action facilitates the update or creation of a business role based on the input parameters provided during the workflow execution. Initially, it checks for the existence of the specified business role. If the role does not exist, it creates a new one with the option to mark it as pending. For an existing role, it updates its name or description as per the parameters. Additionally, this action manages the association or dissociation of SAP roles to the business role based on the workflow instance's affected roles, implementing logic to either remove roles that are no longer needed or add new ones. The action also supports a reverse operation mode (`RunOppositeAction`) to undo previous changes.

**Parameters:**

_Basic:_

-   Name: RunOppositeAction
-   Description: Determines whether to perform the opposite action for the roles association.
-   Default value: False
-   Mandatory: No

-   Name: CreateBusinessRoleAsPending
-   Description: Marks the new business role as pending if true. Useful for scenarios where the role is under review or not fully defined.
-   Default value: False
-   Mandatory: Yes

_Advanced:_

-   Name: updatedBusinessRoleName
-   Description: New name for the business role. Applies only to existing roles.
-   Default value: None
-   Mandatory: No

-   Name: updatedBusinessRoleDescription
-   Description: New description for the business role. This parameter allows updating the role's intent or responsibilities.
-   Default value: None
-   Mandatory: No

**Business impact:** 

This action is crucial for maintaining accurate and up-to-date business roles within the Pathlock Cloud platform, directly impacting access control and compliance. By enabling dynamic updates to business roles, organizations can ensure that their GRC policies stay aligned with current business needs, improving overall security posture and compliance efficiency.

**Example of usage:** 

To update a business roleâ€™s description without altering its active status, one would set `CreateBusinessRoleAsPending` to false and provide values for `updatedBusinessRoleName` and/or `updatedBusinessRoleDescription`. This enables administrators to quickly respond to changes in role functions or responsibilities.

**Prerequisites:** 

- Proper permissions to manage business roles within the Pathlock Cloud platform.
