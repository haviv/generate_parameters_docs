Action Name: ChangeWorkflowToEmployeeUser

**Category:** User Management

**Description:** 

The `ChangeWorkflowToEmployeeUser` action is designed to modify the associated user of a workflow instance to reflect the correct employee user based on provided employee identifiers. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the initial user associated with a workflow instance needs to be updated to accurately represent the employee performing or affected by the workflow. The action performs a lookup using an employee identifier to find a corresponding user record. If such a user is found, and their `UserId` differs from the `UserId` currently associated with the workflow instance, the workflow instance is updated to reflect this user. This process is crucial for ensuring that workflow tasks and permissions are correctly aligned with the actual users involved, thereby maintaining the integrity and accuracy of workflow operations within Pathlock Cloud.

**Parameters:**

_Basic_

- Name: EmployeeIdentifierFieldName
  - Description: This parameter specifies the technical name of the field in the workflow form from which the employee's unique identifier value is retrieved. It is utilized to locate the correct employee by matching this identifier to an employee's record in the system.
  - Default value: N/A
  - Mandatory: Yes

**Business Impact:**

The proper execution of the `ChangeWorkflowToEmployeeUser` action impacts the system by ensuring that workflow instances are accurately associated with the correct employee users. This accuracy is vital for several reasons, including ensuring appropriate access control, enabling accurate tracking and auditing of workflow processes, and enhancing the overall security by aligning permissions with the correct user entities. In environments where compliance, security, and precise user management are paramount, such as in Identity, Governance, and Compliance (IGC) platforms, ensuring the integrity of workflow-user associations directly contributes to the system's reliability and trustworthiness.

**Example of Usage:**

A common scenario for utilizing the `ChangeWorkflowToEmployeeUser` action could be during a process where an employee requests access to a new system within the company. The workflow initiated from this request might initially be associated with a generic user account that handles requests. Upon processing the request, the `ChangeWorkflowToEmployeeUser` action would use the employee's unique identifier (provided in the request form) to lookup and re-associate the workflow instance with the actual user account of the employee, ensuring the subsequent steps in the workflow are accurately associated with the correct individual.

**Prerequisites:**

- The workflow system should be correctly configured and able to access the database where user and employee records are stored.
- A unique identifier for the employee must be present and correctly entered in the workflow form by the requester or pre-filled by the system.
- Adequate permissions to modify workflow instances and user associations must be granted to the executing entity of this action.

**Error Handling and Troubleshooting:**

_Common Errors:_

1. **No User Found**: This error occurs if no user matching the provided employee identifier is found. 
   - **Cause**: Incorrect employee identifier provided or no corresponding user in the database.
   - **Solution**: Verify the employee identifier for accuracy and ensure that the user record exists and is accessible in the system database.

2. **No Employee Identifier Provided**: If the `EmployeeIdentifierFieldName` is left blank or the form does not contain a value for this field.
   - **Cause**: Misconfiguration of the workflow form or an oversight where the employee identifier is not provided.
   - **Solution**: Check the workflow configuration to ensure the `EmployeeIdentifierFieldName` parameter is correctly mapped and populated.

By anticipating these common errors and addressing them proactively, administrators can ensure smoother operation of the `ChangeWorkflowToEmployeeUser` action within the Pathlock Cloud environment.
