# DelegateParentRequest

**Category:** Workflow

**Description:**  
The `DelegateParentRequest` action is designed to automate the delegation process in a workflow system, particularly focusing on returning a request to a specified approval group and handling it according to predefined parameters. It retrieves the information of the current step's initiator, the designated approval group, and applies certain actions such as setting a failure message if no matching approval group is found or no parent request exists. It also updates the manager's decision and sends notifications to the relevant parties. This action is critical in scenarios where conditional rerouting of requests is necessary for process integrity and compliance.

**Parameters:**  
- Basic:
    - Name: DelegateParentRequest_ApprovalGroupField
      Description: The technical name of the field that indicates the approval group for delegation.
      Mandatory: yes
    
    - Name: DelegateParentRequest_DefaultApprovalGroup
      Description: Specifies a default approval group to use if the designated approval group cannot be determined.
      Mandatory: yes
    
    - Name: DelegateParentRequest_CommentForBackStep
      Description: Allows adding a comment for the step that is being delegated back.
      Mandatory: no
      Default value: "Moved back by child workflow"

**Business impact:**  
This action has significant business implications as it ensures that workflow tasks are directed to the appropriate approval group, maintaining process integrity and accountability. It supports compliance by making sure tasks are reviewed by the proper authorities and allows for dynamic rerouting based on specific conditions, thus reducing delays and improving efficiency in task management.

**Example of usage:**  
In a scenario where a workflow task needs to be reassigned to a different approval group due to the absence of the original assignee, the `DelegateParentRequest` action can be configured to redirect the task to the "fallback" approval group, ensuring the task is addressed promptly and by the appropriate parties. This redirection can be accompanied by a comment explaining the reason for the delegation, providing clarity and traceability.

**Prerequisites:**  
- The workflow instance and steps must be correctly configured in the system.
- Approval groups must be predefined and accessible to the workflow engine.
- Necessary permissions to modify workflow steps and delegate tasks.

**Error Handling and Troubleshooting:**  
- **Error:** "No matching Approval Group was found"  
  **Cause:** The specified approval group does not exist or was not correctly identified.  
  **Solution:** Ensure the approval group's name is correctly specified in the parameters. Check for typos or mismatches in the configuration.
  
- **Error:** "No parent workflow request was found"  
  **Cause:** The function attempted to delegate a task in a workflow without a clear initiator or parent step ID.    
  **Solution:** Verify that the workflow is correctly structured and that each step has a clear parent or initiating step. This may require reviewing the configuration of the workflow's steps to ensure proper linkage and identifiers are in place.
