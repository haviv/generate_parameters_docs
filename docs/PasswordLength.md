# PasswordLength Parameter Documentation

## Category
Security Configuration

## Default Value
The default value for `PasswordLength` is defined within the Pathlock GRC platform's common settings. It is not explicitly mentioned in the provided code excerpts.

## Impact Level
High

## Description
The `PasswordLength` parameter specifies the minimum length requirement for user passwords within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It plays a crucial role in enforcing password complexity and security standards across the organization.

## Business Impact
Configuring the `PasswordLength` appropriately can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to weak passwords. A longer password length requirement encourages the creation of complex passwords, thereby increasing the resilience of user accounts against brute force and dictionary attacks. This is vital for protecting sensitive compliance and risk management information handled by the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform.

## Technical Impact when configured
- **Increased Security:** Enforcing a minimum password length can deter attackers by making it computationally more challenging to crack passwords.
- **Compliance:** Meets various regulatory and compliance standards that dictate specific minimum password length requirements.
- **User Impact:** May increase the difficulty for users to remember passwords, potentially leading to a higher rate of password reset requests unless complemented with user education and possibly the use of password managers.

## Example Scenario
Imagine a scenario where an organization must comply with ISO/IEC 27001 standards, which includes implementing strong access control measures. By configuring the `PasswordLength` to a robust value, say 12 characters, the organization can ensure that the passwords used within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform meet this requirement, contributing to the overall security posture and compliance.

## Related Settings
- PasswordComplexityRequirements: Defines additional password complexity rules such as the inclusion of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
- PasswordExpirationPolicy: Determines how frequently passwords must be changed.
- AccountLockoutThreshold: Specifies the number of failed login attempts allowed before locking the account.

## Best Practices
- **Configure When:**
  - The organization is required to comply with industry regulations that dictate specific password lengths.
  - Enhancing the security posture of the Pathlock GRC platform is a priority.
- **Avoid When:**
  - Users struggle significantly with password memorability, leading to increased risk of passwords being written down or reused across platforms. Consider using supplemental security measures like multi-factor authentication in such cases.

Given the role of `PasswordLength` in securing sensitive GRC data, organizations should carefully consider their specific risk profile and compliance requirements when configuring this parameter. Regular user education on the importance of secure password practices, coupled with the enforcement of robust password policies, can significantly mitigate the risk of data breaches.
