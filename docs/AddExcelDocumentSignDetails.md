# Add Excel Document Sign Details

**Technical Name:** AddExcelDocumentSignDetails  
**Category:** Reporting  
**Default Value:** Not applicable  
**Impact Level:** Medium  
**Description:** Enables the inclusion of signature details when generating Excel documents in the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform, ensuring that reports generated have an added layer of verification and authenticity. This is particularly useful for audit trails and compliance reporting.  
**Business Impact:** Including signature details in Excel documents enhances the integrity and trustworthiness of the reports generated within an organization. This feature supports compliance with audit requirements by providing verifiable evidence of the report's origin and authenticity, which is critical for many regulatory and compliance standards.  
**Technical Impact when configured:** When this parameter is enabled, Excel documents produced by the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform will include signature details. This may slightly increase the size of the generated files and could affect the generation time for large reports. However, the benefit of having authenticated documents outweighs these minimal impacts.  
**Examples Scenario:** A compliance officer needs to generate an audit trail report for an external auditor review. By enabling `AddExcelDocumentSignDetails`, the report includes signature information, thereby providing the auditor with a verifiable document directly from the GRC platform, streamlining the audit process.  
**Related Settings:**   
- `DisableHeader`: Determines if the header row is included in the exported Excel document. This setting can be used in conjunction to tailor the output document further.  
- `AdditionalDataExtractorTablesForSyncOrg`: While not directly related, understanding how additional data is included in reports can be crucial for auditing and compliance.

**Applicable Workflows Actions:** 
- Generating compliance reports
- Exporting audit trails
- Custom report generation for regulatory purposes

**Best Practices:**  
- **Configure when:** You are generating reports that will be used as evidence in audits or for compliance purposes where verification of document origin and integrity is necessary.
- **Avoid when:** Generating internal documents where signature details are not necessary, as this might unnecessarily increase document size and generation times.

**Context:** The `AddExcelDocumentSignDetails` parameter is crucial for enabling the addition of verifiable signature details to Excel documents generated by the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This functionality enhances the compliance and auditing capabilities of the platform, making it invaluable for organizations that require stringent compliance and audit trail capabilities.
