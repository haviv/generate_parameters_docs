# Documentation for `ApplicationSignoutUrl` Parameter

## Category:
- Configuration/Settings

## Default Value:
- `~/ApplicationSignout.aspx`

## Impact Level:
- Application Behavior

## Description:
The `ApplicationSignoutUrl` parameter specifies the URL to which the application redirects users upon signout. This URL is intended to be the endpoint that handles the logout process, ensuring users are appropriately signed out of the application.

## Business Impact:
Configuring the `ApplicationSignoutUrl` ensures a smooth user experience by directing users to a specified page once they decide to sign out. It helps in maintaining the security of the application by ensuring that users are properly logged out, thereby preventing unauthorized access to user sessions.

## Technical Impact when configured:
- Enhances user experience by providing a clear path after signing out.
- Improves application security by ensuring a proper signout process.
- Allows for custom signout logic by redirecting to a specified URL.

## Example Scenario:
An e-commerce application uses the `ApplicationSignoutUrl` to redirect users to a "Thank you for visiting" page after they sign out. This provides a positive end-user experience and an opportunity for the business to convey any last-minute messages or offers.

## Related Settings:
- `LoginUrl` - Specifies the URL to the login page.
- `SessionTimeoutUrl` - Specifies the URL to redirect users to when a session times out.

## Best Practices:
- **Configure when**:
  - You need to direct users to a specific page after signing out, such as a custom message page or the application homepage.
  - You have specific logout procedures or operations that need to be performed (e.g., cleaning up session data, logging logout activities).
- **Avoid when**:
  - Default signout behavior meets your applicationâ€™s requirements, and no specific actions are needed after signing out.

## Context:
The `ApplicationSignoutUrl` parameter is used within web applications to manage user signout behavior. It is a part of application settings that can be customized to enhance security and user experience by ensuring a controlled signout process.
