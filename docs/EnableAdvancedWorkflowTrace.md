# EnableAdvancedWorkflowTrace Parameter Documentation

## Category
Workflow Configuration

## Default Value
`false`

## Impact Level
High

## Description
The `EnableAdvancedWorkflowTrace` parameter is designed to enable or disable advanced tracing features within the workflow components of the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. When enabled, this setting triggers the logging of detailed information about workflow operations, including file uploads, role list modifications, folder permission changes, and error reporting which can significantly aid in debugging and monitoring the workflow processes.

## Business Impact
Enabling advanced workflow trace can provide in-depth insights into the workflow processes, facilitating better audit trails, compliance monitoring, and operational visibility. This can be crucial for identifying inefficiencies, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring the integrity and security of workflow operations within the organization.

## Technical Impact when Configured
- **Enhanced Debugging:** Detailed logging assists developers and system administrators in identifying and resolving issues more efficiently.
- **Increased Logging Volume:** May result in larger log files, impacting storage resources.
- **Performance Considerations:** While offering valuable insights, enabling this parameter might slightly impact system performance due to the increased logging activities.

## Examples Scenario
- **Troubleshooting Workflow Issues:** If workflows related to role modifications or file permissions fail without clear errors, enabling this trace can uncover the underlying issues by providing detailed logs of each operation.
- **Audit and Compliance:** Organizations subject to strict compliance requirements can enable advanced tracing to ensure all workflow actions are logged, providing an audit trail for internal or regulatory reviews.

## Related Settings
- `Logger.WriteInformationToLog`: The underlying method called for logging information when `EnableAdvancedWorkflowTrace` is enabled.
- Other logging-related parameters within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform settings.

## Best Practices
- **Configure when:**
  - Detailed audit trails are required for compliance purposes.
  - Troubleshooting complex workflow issues where standard logs do not provide sufficient information.
- **Avoid when:**
  - The system is under heavy load and performance impact is a concern.
  - Log storage resources are limited, as enabled tracing will increase log file sizes.

## Context
The `EnableAdvancedWorkflowTrace` parameter plays a vital role in the administration and maintenance of workflows within the Pathlock Cloud GRC environment. By providing an option to capture detailed logs of workflow operations, administrators can gain better visibility into the system's behavior, aiding in troubleshooting, security, and compliance efforts. However, careful consideration should be given to its impact on system performance and log management practices.
