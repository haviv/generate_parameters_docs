# Authorization Value For Automatic Object Level

**Technical Name:** AuthorizationValueForAutomaticObjectLevel

**Category:** Security

**Default Value:** Not specified

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

The parameter `AuthorizationValueForAutomaticObjectLevel` is designed to automate the authorization process at the object level. It plays a crucial role in enhancing access control by setting predefined authorization values that are applied automatically, reducing manual errors and ensuring a consistent security posture across the platform.

**Business Impact:**

Misconfiguration of this parameter can lead to unauthorized access, compromising sensitive data integrity and confidentiality. On the flip side, correctly configuring it aids in enforcing granular access control, aligning with least privilege principles and regulatory compliance requirements, thereby safeguarding critical business processes and data from potential security threats.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- Ensures that objects within the Pathlock platform are accessed by users with the right levels of authorization.
- Automates the assignment of permission levels, reducing administrative overhead and the potential for manual errors.
- Helps in achieving compliance by enforcing access controls that meet industry standards and regulations.

**Examples Scenario:**

Consider a financial organization that employs the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to manage access to financial reports. By using `AuthorizationValueForAutomaticObjectLevel`, the organization can automate the process of granting access to these reports. For instance, it can configure the system to automatically assign read-only access to junior financial analysts, while senior analysts get both read and write permissions. This ensures that each employee has access strictly based on their role, enhancing data security and compliance.
