# Documentation for `SendMailOnlyToSpecificAddresses`

## Category:
Email Filtering

## Default Value:
(None) The default setting is typically an empty string, indicating that no specific email address filtering is applied.

## Impact Level:
Medium

## Description:
The `SendMailOnlyToSpecificAddresses` parameter is used to restrict outgoing emails from the application to a predefined list of email addresses. When this parameter is set, emails generated by the application are only sent to those addresses that match the ones specified in the `SendMailOnlyToSpecificAddresses` setting. Addresses can be separated by semicolons (`;`) or commas (`,`).

## Business Impact:
Enabling this feature can significantly reduce the risk of sending sensitive information to unintended recipients. It ensures that automated emails, possibly containing sensitive or critical business data, are only sent to authorized addresses. This can be crucial for maintaining data privacy and adhering to compliance standards.

## Technical Impact when configured:
- When configured, the email sending functionality within the application will evaluate the `SendMailOnlyToSpecificAddresses` setting before dispatching emails.
- Only the emails that match the addresses specified in the list will be sent out. All other emails will be filtered out and not sent.
- This filtering happens irrespective of other email-related settings unless specific conditions are met (e.g., professional user filters).

## Example Scenario:
In a scenario where a company wants to ensure that automated report emails are only sent to the auditing department and no one else, the `SendMailOnlyToSpecificAddresses` can be configured with the auditing department's email addresses. This way, only those specified in the setting will receive the emails, enhancing data security and compliance with internal policies.

## Related Settings:
- `SendMailOnlyToProfessionalUsers`: Another filtering setting that, when enabled, restricts email sending to users marked as professional.

## Best Practices:
- **Configure when:**
  - You need to ensure that automated emails from the system are restricted to specific, intended recipients.
  - There's a need to comply with internal or external data protection policies that require strict control over email recipients.
- **Avoid when:**
  - The system needs to send emails to a broad audience without stringent restrictions.
  - Specific email recipient filtering is not required, to avoid unnecessary complexity and maintenance overhead.

## Context:
The `SendMailOnlyToSpecificAddresses` setting is particularly relevant for environments where data sensitivity and information control are paramount. It provides an additional layer of security by ensuring that emails, potentially containing sensitive data, are only sent to designated addresses. This functionality is integral to systems that require precise control over information dissemination, such as in financial, healthcare, and governmental sectors.
