# Change Documents Show Change Type Column

**Technical Name:** ChangeDocumentsShowChangeTypeColumn

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This setting controls the visibility of the 'Change Type' column in change document reports. Activating this parameter will display the type of change (Insert, Update, Delete) made within the monitored systems, enhancing the granularity and transparency of reported changes.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling this parameter ensures that stakeholders have a detailed view of the changes made, supporting better audit trails and compliance management. It is particularly useful in environments where tracking the minutiae of changes is critical for security and compliance reasons.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, reports generated by the change document service will include an additional column that details the type of change made. This requires additional processing and could have a minor impact on report generation times due to the extra data retrieval and display logic.

**Examples Scenario:**

A compliance officer needs to provide an audit trail for a specific period, showcasing not only what changes were made to sensitive configurations but also the nature of those changes (e.g., were critical permissions granted or revoked). With this parameter enabled, the generated report will include a dedicated column for the change type, facilitating a more thorough compliance review.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** Greater detail is required for audit trails and compliance reports to satisfy internal or external audit requirements.
- **Avoid when:** There is a need to optimize for report generation speed and the inclusion of change types is not a requirement for compliance or internal policies.
