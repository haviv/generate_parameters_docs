**Technical Name:** SkippedStepsInWorkflowFlowDocumention

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** Not Applicable

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter controls whether certain steps within a workflow can be optionally skipped under predefined conditions, enhancing flexibility and efficiency in process management. It is crucial for tailoring the workflow process in dynamic business environments where not all steps need to be executed under certain conditions.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling the skipping of workflow steps can significantly expedite processes, ensuring that unnecessary delays are avoided, especially in scenarios that require rapid decision-making and action. This can lead to improved operational efficiency, cost savings, and enhanced responsiveness to compliance and risk management requirements.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, this parameter allows certain steps within a workflow to be bypassed based on specific criteria, such as the absence of a need for approval or review. This functionality is vital for streamlining processes and making them more adaptive to the context of the operation, reducing manual interventions and possibly error rates.

**Examples Scenario:**

In a user access review workflow, a step requiring managerial approval for access continuation can be skipped if the system detects no changes in the user's role or access level from the last review cycle, thereby speeding up the review process.

**Best Practices:** configure when steps in the workflow are identified as non-critical or redundant in certain conditions to improve process efficiency. Avoid when every step is crucial for audit, compliance, or security reasons to ensure thorough checks are conducted.
