**Enable User Multiple Usage Recognize**

**Technical Name:** EnableUserMultipleUsageRecognize

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** This parameter controls whether the system recognizes and handles multiple usage instances of a user within a specified time range. It determines how the system logs and responds to repeated actions by the same user, aiming to enhance monitoring and analysis of user behavior in the system.

**Business Impact:** Enabling this feature can help organizations in identifying unusual patterns of user behavior, which could indicate potential security risks, such as shared user credentials or automated attack attempts. It also aids in compliance by ensuring users' actions are uniquely logged and can be audited properly.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When enabled, the system aggregates user actions within a predefined time range, allowing for more sophisticated analysis of user behavior. It affects how logs are handled and stored, potentially increasing the volume of data but providing richer insights into user activities.

**Examples Scenario:** If a user performs the same action repeatedly within a short period, this could be flagged for review. For example, a user logging into a system multiple times within a few minutes might indicate a shared account or an automated login script, both of which could pose security risks.

**Best Practices:** configure when comprehensive user activity logs are needed for security or compliance purposes; avoid when minimal logging is sufficient or if excessive logging could overwhelm system resources.
