**Technical Name:** DailyEmailExcelEventColumnWidth

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:** 5

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** The `DailyEmailExcelEventColumnWidth` parameter controls the column width for Excel attachments sent with daily email notifications. This setting ensures that the generated Excel reports have columns properly sized to display the content without manual adjustment by the recipient.

**Business Impact:** Adjusting the column width can significantly improve the readability and accessibility of the report data in Excel attachments. Properly sized columns facilitate easier analysis and decision-making processes for stakeholders reviewing the daily emails.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When configured, this parameter determines the default width of the columns in the Excel files attached to daily email notifications. It helps in standardizing the presentation of event data across all reports, ensuring consistency and readability.

**Examples Scenario:** 
- In a scenario where daily email reports are sent to department managers to review transaction histories or event summaries, ensuring that the Excel attachment's columns are not too narrow or too wide can help in quickly scanning and understanding the data, thus improving the efficiency of daily operations.

**Best Practices:** 
- Configure when: Adjustments to the default value may be necessary based on specific user feedback or to accommodate changes in the volume or nature of the data being reported.
- Avoid when: If the daily reports are rarely opened or reviewed in Excel, or if feedback indicates satisfaction with the current default setting, it may be unnecessary to adjust this parameter.
