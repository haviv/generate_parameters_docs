# Mixed Windows Secondary Domain Name

**Technical Name:** MixedWindowsSecondaryDomainName

**Category:** User Management

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** 

The Mixed Windows Secondary Domain Name parameter is used to specify an additional domain name in scenarios where users may be authenticated against a secondary domain in a mixed environment. This is particularly useful in environments where users from different domains need to access the system, and there is a need to segregate or specifically identify users from a secondary domain.

**Business Impact:**

Utilizing the Mixed Windows Secondary Domain Name allows for more granular control over user access and authentication, enhancing security and operational efficiency. It aids in ensuring that users are correctly authenticated within their respective domains, thereby mitigating the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches. 

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, this parameter enforces the inclusion of a domain name during the login process for users attempting to authenticate against the specified secondary domain. This ensures that the authentication process is routed correctly, leveraging the intended domainâ€™s authentication mechanisms.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Scenario:** A company operates with a primary domain for regular employees and a secondary domain for contractors and external partners. By configuring the Mixed Windows Secondary Domain Name, IT administrators can ensure that users from the secondary domain are authenticated against their specific domain policies, enhancing security and access management.

**Related Settings:** 

- `RequireDomainNameInMixedLogin`

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** You are managing a mixed domain environment where users from a secondary domain need to authenticate to access the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This is crucial for organizations that employ contractors or have mergers/acquisitions, requiring seamless integration without compromising security.
- **Avoid when:** All users are from a single domain, or there is no clear segregation needed between primary and secondary domain users. This avoids unnecessary complexity in the authentication process.
