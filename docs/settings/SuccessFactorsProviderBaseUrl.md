# Success Factors Provider Base Url

**Technical Name:** SuccessFactorsProviderBaseUrl 

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** 

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

The SuccessFactorsProviderBaseUrl parameter is used to set the base URL for SAP SuccessFactors, enabling the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to communicate with the SuccessFactors API for organizational structure data.

**Business Impact:**

Configuring the SuccessFactorsProviderBaseUrl correctly is crucial for ensuring timely and accurate synchronization of organizational structure data between SAP SuccessFactors and the Pathlock platform. This ensures that governance, risk, and compliance data reflect the current organizational hierarchy and user roles within the business, impacting compliance reporting, risk management, and security policy enforcement.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Upon configuration, this parameter directs the Pathlock platform to the specified SuccessFactors API endpoint. The platform then performs API calls to retrieve or update organizational structure data, such as departments, roles, and user information. This is vital for maintaining up-to-date information within the Pathlock system, which forms the backbone of its GRC capabilities.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Scenario 1:** A company uses SAP SuccessFactors for HR management and requires real-time updates in Pathlock for any changes in user roles or department structures. Configuring the SuccessFactorsProviderBaseUrl ensures that any changes in SuccessFactors are automatically reflected in the Pathlock platform, enabling accurate access controls and compliance reporting.
