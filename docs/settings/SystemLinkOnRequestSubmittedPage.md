**Technical Name:** SystemLinkOnRequestSubmittedPage

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

Enables or disables the display of a system link on the page shown after a request is submitted in the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This feature is designed to improve navigability and user experience by providing direct access to relevant system information or actions related to the request just made.

**Business Impact:**

Including the system link on the request submitted page can significantly enhance the user's understanding and management of requests, especially in complex GRC (Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance) processes. It aids in ensuring that users can easily navigate to related system settings or information, reducing the need for manual search and thereby increasing productivity and compliance operational efficiency.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, users will see a hyperlink that directs them to the corresponding system information or action page related to their request. This feature can lead to a more streamlined workflow, enabling users to quickly move between relevant parts of the GRC platform without unnecessary navigation steps.

**Examples Scenario:**

After submitting a request for a new role assignment within the GRC platform, a user is presented with a confirmation page. With SystemLinkOnRequestSubmittedPage enabled, this page includes a direct link to the role's details or the status of their request, allowing for immediate follow-up or additional actions.

**Best Practices:** configure when you want to enhance user experience by providing quick access to related information right after a request submission; avoid when unnecessary to prevent over-cluttering the user interface.
