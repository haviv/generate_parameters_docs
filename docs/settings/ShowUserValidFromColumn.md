**Technical Name:** ShowUserValidFromColumn

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** False

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter controls whether the "Valid From" column is displayed for user records. When enabled, it allows administrators to view the start date from which a user's account is considered valid.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling the "Valid From" column provides better visibility into user account lifecycles, facilitating improved user management and security oversight. It is particularly useful for auditing and compliance purposes, allowing organizations to track when user access begins.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When activated, the user interface will include a column showing the date from which each user account is valid. This can assist in identifying accounts that are newly created or have recently been modified to become active.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Auditing:** Compliance officers can quickly identify when a user was granted access, aiding in audits concerning user access and entitlements.
  
- **User Management:** IT administrators can use this information to review and clean up user accounts that should no longer be active, based on the start date of their validity.

- `UserOpenRequestsShowApprovalGroupDescription`

**Best Practices:** configure when you need detailed auditing and visibility into when user accounts become active. Avoid when unnecessary to minimize information overload in the user interface.
