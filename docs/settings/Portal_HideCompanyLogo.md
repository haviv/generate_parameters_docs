# Portal Hide Company Logo

**Technical Name:** Portal_HideCompanyLogo

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Low

**Description:**

The `Portal_HideCompanyLogo` parameter allows administrators to control the visibility of the company logo within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. When enabled, this setting removes the company logo from the portal, offering a more generic or branded interface based on organizational requirements.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling this feature can help organizations comply with branding guidelines, especially in environments where displaying company logos is restricted or when a more neutral interface is preferred for security or privacy reasons.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When this parameter is configured to hide the company logo, users will not see the company logo across the entirety of the GRC portal. This could influence user experience by creating a more streamlined or less brand-centric interface.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Scenario 1:** A company undergoing a rebranding process may choose to hide their outdated logo from the GRC portal until the new branding is finalized.

- **Scenario 2:** For companies providing Pathlock access to external auditors or partners, hiding company-specific branding elements like the logo can provide a neutral interface, minimizing distractions and focusing on functionality.

**Related Settings:**

- Portal_Address_Url
- Portal_Header

**Best Practices:** configure when a neutral interface is preferred or branding guidelines restrict logo display. Avoid when company branding is a crucial part of user experience within the GRC portal.
