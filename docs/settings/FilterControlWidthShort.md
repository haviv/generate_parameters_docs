**Impact Level:** Low

**Description:**

The Filter Control Width Short parameter is a configuration setting in Pathlock Cloud GRC platform's user interface (UI) component, specifically designed for controlling the width of various filter controls. It allows for the customization of filter UI elements to better fit the visual and layout requirements of the application.

**Business Impact:**

Adjusting this parameter allows business users to customize and optimize the UI of reports and filters, leading to enhanced usability and better user experience. It enables a more organized display of information by tailoring the width of filter controls to match content length and screen real estate, thereby improving data readability and interaction efficiency.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, this parameter directly affects the user interface of the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform by altering the width dimensions of filter controls. This can influence layout, visibility, and user interaction with filter elements across various reports and filterable data presentations.

**Examples Scenario:**

A report designed for security audit purposes contains a variety of filters including actions, roles, and usage metrics. The default width of these filter controls may not optimally display the full names or values, potentially hindering the usability. Adjusting the Filter Control Width Short parameter enables the customization of these controlsâ€™ widths, ensuring all titles and selections are fully visible without the need for unnecessary scrolling or hovering, thereby facilitating a smoother user interaction.
