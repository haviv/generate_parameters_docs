**Category:** User Management 

**Default Value:** None 

**Impact Level:** High 

**Description:**
This parameter specifies the username for newly created user accounts within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It is essential for defining unique identifiers for new users in the system, ensuring that each account can be individually managed and audited.

**Business Impact:**
Proper configuration of this parameter ensures that new user accounts are easily identifiable and traceable, simplifying user management and enhancing security posture. It also prevents potential conflicts by avoiding duplicate usernames, thereby supporting effective access control and compliance with security policies.

**Technical Impact when configured:** 
Configuring this parameter affects the creation of new user accounts by setting a predetermined structure or naming convention for usernames. This can impact both the security and organization of user accounts within the system. 

**Examples Scenario:** 
- During the onboarding of a new employee, the system automatically generates a username based on predefined criteria, ensuring it fits the organization's standard naming conventions.
- In a scenario where batch user creation is required, this parameter ensures that all new accounts adhere to a uniform username format, facilitating easier management and integration.

**Related Settings:** None 

**Best Practices:** 
- **Configure when:** Setting up the system for the first time or when revising user account creation policies to ensure consistency and adherence to security policies.
- **Avoid when:** There is a need for highly customized user names that cannot follow a uniform pattern, or when such configurations might lead to conflicts with existing usernames or policies.
