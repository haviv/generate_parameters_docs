# Workflow Header Direction Left to Right

**Technical Name:** WorkflowHeaderDirectionLTR

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** N/A

**Impact Level:** Low

**Description:** This parameter controls the alignment of headers in workflow-related reports and screens, setting them to display from left to right (LTR).

**Business Impact:** Aligning headers left to right improves readability and user experience for users accustomed to LTR scripts, facilitating quicker comprehension and navigation through workflow-related reports and interfaces.

**Technical Impact when configured:** Sets the global direction for workflow headers to be left to right across the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform, affecting how information is displayed and interacted with in the system.

**Examples Scenario:** In a Roles Matrix Report, setting the WorkflowHeaderDirectionLTR parameter ensures that all column headers start from the left edge of the page, moving right. This is particularly useful for organizations in regions where left to right reading is standard, enhancing the efficiency of report analysis and decision-making processes.

**Related Settings:** N/A

**Best Practices:** 
- **Configure when:** You are operating in a region where left to right is the standard script direction, or when your organization's reporting standards require LTR alignment for consistency.
- **Avoid when:** The default directionality settings meet your organizational requirements or when your organization uses RTL (Right to Left) script direction standard.
