# HR Role Prefix

**Technical Name:** HR_RolePrefix

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The HR Role Prefix parameter is used to define a prefix for HR-related roles within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This prefix helps in distinguishing HR roles from other types of roles and in organizing role-based access controls more efficiently.

**Business Impact:**

Setting an appropriate HR Role Prefix can streamline role management and improve security by making it easier to identify and audit HR roles. It ensures that only authorized users are granted access to sensitive HR information, thus protecting employee data and aiding in compliance with privacy regulations.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When the HR Role Prefix is configured, the system will automatically prepend the specified prefix to all new and existing HR roles within the system. This aids in role categorization, search, and auditing processes by providing a clear identifier for HR-specific roles.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Scenario 1:** An organization wants to easily identify all HR roles for auditing purposes. By configuring the HR Role Prefix as "HR_", all HR roles can be quickly filtered and audited without sifting through non-HR roles.
  
- **Scenario 2:** During role cleanup, an administrator needs to identify outdated HR roles for deletion. The HR Role Prefix makes it easier to segregate these roles from the rest, ensuring non-HR roles are not accidentally affected.

**Related Settings:**

- **HRStructualAuthorizationsProvider:** Manages data sourcing for HR roles, including those with the HR Role Prefix.
- **ExcelMatrix_MaxNumberOfCharsToSetRowHight:** While not directly related, settings like these impact how role data is presented and can interplay with role management processes.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** Setting up or reorganizing role-based access controls within the Pathlock platform. It is particularly useful when there are a significant number of HR roles.
- **Avoid when:** If the organization does not have a clear naming convention or if the addition of a prefix could complicate role management processes.
