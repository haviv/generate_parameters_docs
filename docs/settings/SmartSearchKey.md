**Technical Name:** SmartSearchKey

**Category:** User Management

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The SmartSearchKey parameter is designed to enhance search capabilities within the Pathlock GRC platform, focusing on user-specific transactions. It allows for more precise filtering and sorting of transaction history by matching user profiles with particular system IDs.

**Business Impact:**

By enabling a more accurate and efficient search of transaction histories, the SmartSearchKey can significantly improve monitoring and compliance activities. It streamlines the process of identifying and analyzing user actions within specific systems, aiding in fraud detection, audit trails, and compliance reporting.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, the SmartSearchKey filters transaction histories to only include actions performed by a specified user within a designated system. This targeting provides a refined set of data for analysis, reducing the time and resources spent sifting through irrelevant information.

**Example Scenario:**

A compliance officer needs to review all transactions made by a particular user within the SAP system over the last quarter. By applying the SmartSearchKey with the user's SAP username and specifying the system ID for SAP, the officer can quickly retrieve a list of distinct transaction IDs related to that user's actions, facilitating efficient review and analysis.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** There's a need to audit or review user actions within specific systems, to enhance security and compliance measures, or when monitoring for unauthorized or suspicious activities.
- **Avoid when:** Broad system-wide data reviews are necessary where user-specific actions are not as relevant, or if the system performance could be adversely affected by the added filtering complexity.
