**Description:**

The `TechnicalNameForEmployeeLastName` parameter is utilized within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform as part of various user lifecycle management workflows to accurately identify and apply user details, specifically the employee's last name, in user creation and management processes. This parameter ensures that user accounts are created with consistent naming conventions across different systems, enhancing identity management and security posture.

**Business Impact:**

Using the `TechnicalNameForEmployeeLastName` parameter correctly ensures that employee records are accurately reflected in the system, facilitating easier user identification, audit processes, and compliance with internal and external regulations related to user account management. It reduces the risks of duplicate user accounts, unauthorized access, and potential security breaches by maintaining standardized user naming conventions.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, this parameter helps in automating the creation and management of user accounts by using a consistent naming convention for the last names of employees. This automation significantly reduces manual errors, streamlines user onboarding and offboarding processes, and supports compliance with security policies that demand consistent user identity management across all organizational systems.

**Examples Scenario:**

For instance, in a scenario where a new user needs to be onboarded into the organization's systems, the `TechnicalNameForEmployeeLastName` will be used to generate a username that might include the last name of the employee as part of the organization's standard username pattern. This ensures that the user's identity is clearly reflected across all systems, simplifying management and audit trails.
