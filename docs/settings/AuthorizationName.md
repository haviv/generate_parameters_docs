# Authorization Name

**Technical Name:** AuthorizationName

**Category:** Security

**Default Value:** N/A

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

The `AuthorizationName` parameter is utilized within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to dynamically identify and classify user authorizations across different contexts, including roles, applications, jobs, and profiles. It plays a critical role in customizing authorization checks based on specific business requirements and security protocols.

**Business Impact:**

Effective utilization of the `AuthorizationName` parameter enhances an organization's ability to manage and secure access controls efficiently. This fine-grained authorization contributes to minimizing potential security risks by ensuring only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data and operations, thereby safeguarding organizational data integrity and compliance standards.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, the `AuthorizationName` parameter interacts with custom authorization providers to fetch and certify user authorization objects based on roles, applications, job specifications, or profile attributes. This enables the Pathlock platform to offer tailored authorization certifications and reports, enhancing security and compliance management.

**Examples Scenario:**

- A company can utilize the `AuthorizationName` to differentiate access controls between various departments such as finance, HR, and IT. For example, ensuring that only HR has access to employee personal data.
- In a compliance audit scenario, an organization can specify authorization names relevant to specific regulatory requirements to streamline audit processes and ensure users have appropriate access rights as per compliance standards.
