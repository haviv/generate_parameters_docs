# Event On Employee Position Title Change

**Technical Name:** EventOnEmployeePositionTitleChange

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** 

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

Monitors changes to employee position titles within the organization and triggers specified workflows or alerts based on these changes. This parameter is crucial for maintaining up-to-date records on employee roles and ensuring that access rights and responsibilities are accurately assigned according to position titles.

**Business Impact:**

Ensures that role-based access controls and responsibilities are dynamically updated in response to changes in employee position titles, mitigating the risk of inappropriate access and enhancing compliance with internal policies and external regulations. It supports a proactive approach to maintaining organizational integrity, operational efficiency, and compliance.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Proper configuration results in real-time identification and tracking of changes in employee positions, enabling automated adjustments to access rights and responsibilities. This automation reduces manual overhead, minimizes human error, and ensures timely updates to critical security and operational systems.

**Examples Scenario:**

An employee is promoted from a Junior Accountant to a Senior Accountant. This change in position title prompts an automatic review of access permissions, ensuring the employee is granted additional access required for the new role and that any unnecessary access from the previous role is revoked, maintaining stringent security and compliance standards.

**Related Settings:**

- `EventDefaultSeverity`: Defines the default severity level for events when a specific severity is not assigned. This setting is particularly relevant when considering the importance of accurately reflecting the impact of position title changes within an organization's GRC platform.

**Best Practices:** 

Configure when:
- Implementing or refining role-based access controls.
- Streamlining HR and IT collaboration on employee status changes.
- Compliance requirements mandate strict oversight of access based on roles.

Avoid when:
- The organization operates in a static structure with infrequent role changes, which might not justify the overhead of monitoring and automation.
