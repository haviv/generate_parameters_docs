**Technical Name:** WorkflowActionsNotifierWorkerProcess_WorkflowInstanceId

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** 

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** This parameter uniquely identifies an instance in the Workflow Actions Notifier worker process. It is used to specify and reference specific workflow actions within Pathlock's cloud-based GRC platform, enabling fine-grained control over notification and processing behavior in workflow-related tasks.

**Business Impact:** Proper configuration of this parameter ensures that notifications and alerts generated by workflow actions are accurately targeted and managed, enhancing the efficiency of business processes related to governance, risk, and compliance (GRC). Misconfiguration could lead to missed notifications or alerts, potentially delaying response times to critical events or tasks within the GRC workflow.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When this parameter is correctly configured, it helps in streamlining the notification process by ensuring that the right workflow instances are notified at the correct time. It reduces errors in notifications, improves response time to workflow tasks, and enhances overall compliance and risk management processes.

**Examples Scenario:** If an organization wants to configure notifications for a risk assessment approval workflow, the `WorkflowActionsNotifierWorkerProcess_WorkflowInstanceId` can be set to correspond with that specific workflow instance. This ensures that when the risk assessment workflow reaches particular stages requiring notifications, the system accurately targets these alerts to the designated recipients involved in that process.

**Related Settings:** 

- `WorkflowActionSendMailForEachEmployee`
- `CheckSodForEmployees`

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** Setting up specific workflows that require targeted notifications. This ensures that each workflow instance has its unique identifier, reducing the risks of misdirected alerts.
  
- **Avoid when:** Non-distinct workflow instances do not require specific notification settings. Using unique identifiers unnecessarily can complicate configuration without adding value.
