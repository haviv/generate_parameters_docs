**Business Impact:** Including risk descriptions in impact analyses can greatly enhance the understanding of potential risks, making it easier for stakeholders to gauge the severity and implications of security, compliance, or governance issues within their organizations. This leads to more effective risk mitigation strategies.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When enabled, this setting ensures that every entry in the risk report is accompanied by a descriptive elaboration of the risk. This can affect the report's length and the detail level, potentially making the reports more actionable for users.

**Examples Scenario:** If an organization is undergoing an audit and needs to present a report on potential risks to its ERP system, enabling this parameter will ensure the report includes not just a list of risks but also descriptions for each. This can provide auditors with clear insights into what each risk entails and why it is a concern, facilitating a more effective review and remediation process.
