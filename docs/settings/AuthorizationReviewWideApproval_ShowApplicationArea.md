**Authorization Review Wide Approval Show Application Area**

**Technical Name:** AuthorizationReviewWideApproval_ShowApplicationArea

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** True

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** This parameter controls the visibility of the application area within the authorization review process, allowing for a broader review scope by displaying or hiding application-specific approval areas.

**Business Impact:** Enabling this parameter ensures that reviewers have visibility into the specific areas of applications that require authorization approvals, supporting a comprehensive review process. This can directly impact the efficiency and thoroughness of the authorization review, potentially affecting the organization's overall security posture and compliance with internal policies and external regulations.

**Technical Impact when configured:** 

- When enabled, this parameter ensures that the application area is visible during the authorization review process, facilitating a more detailed and informed review by showing relevant application-specific information.

- When disabled, the visibility of application-specific approval areas is hidden, which may streamline the review process but at the cost of potentially overlooking application-specific authorization requirements.

**Examples Scenario:** If an organization needs to conduct thorough reviews of authorizations, particularly in a complex ecosystem of applications and roles, enabling this parameter ensures that reviewers can see and consider application-specific areas, enabling more precise and informed decisions.
