# Application Signout Url

**Technical Name:** ApplicationSignoutUrl

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** None Provided

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The Application Signout Url parameter specifies the URL to which users will be redirected when they sign out from the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This setting is crucial for enhancing the user management and signout experience, ensuring a smooth transition out of the application.

**Business Impact:**

Configuring the Application Signout Url has a direct impact on user experience and security. It ensures that users are directed to a predetermined location after signout, which can help in reinforcing the security posture by preventing redirection to potentially hazardous sites. Additionally, it can be leveraged to redirect users to other relevant corporate resources, enhancing the overall user experience and maintaining engagement.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When properly configured, the Application Signout Url ensures that all users exiting the Pathlock platform are redirected to a specified URL. This can be particularly useful for directing users towards corporate portals, compliance pages, or other applications within the organization’s ecosystem, thus maintaining a controlled and consistent cybersecurity environment.

**Examples Scenario:**

An organization utilizes Pathlock Cloud GRC for managing its compliance requirements. The IT department configures the Application Signout Url parameter to redirect users to the company’s internal portal upon signout. This move aims to streamline access to other compliance resources and keep users within the secure environment of the corporate network.

**Related Settings:** None

**Best Practices:** configure when, avoid when

- **Configure when:** You want to maintain a controlled navigation flow for users exiting the application, especially to enhance security measures by preventing redirection to potentially malicious sites.
- **Avoid when:** There is no clear need or benefit in redirecting users to a specific URL post-signout. If the redirection could lead to confusion or if users should not be directed to any particular site after signing out.
