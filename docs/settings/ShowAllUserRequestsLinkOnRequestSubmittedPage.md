# Show All User Requests Link On Request Submitted Page

**Technical Name:** ShowAllUserRequestsLinkOnRequestSubmittedPage

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** Not provided in the code references. 

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This configuration parameter controls the visibility of a link that allows users to view all of their requests directly from the Request Submitted page. When enabled, it provides a quick and easy way for users to review their request history without navigating away from the confirmation page.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling this feature enhances the user experience by simplifying access to request histories, fostering transparency, and enabling easier tracking of their submissions. It can be particularly useful in environments where users submit a high volume of requests and need to keep track of them efficiently.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Once enabled, a link is prominently displayed on the Request Submitted page, giving users immediate access to their entire request history with a single click.

**Example Scenario:**

A user submits a new access request via the Pathlock GRC platform. Upon successful submission, the Request Submitted page is displayed. With this parameter configured, the user sees a link labeled "View All Requests" (or similar wording based on customization) directly on this page. Clicking on this link takes the user to a summary page listing all past and current requests they have made, facilitating quick review and follow-up if necessary.

**Related Settings:** Not specified in the provided code references.
