The Employee Alternative Key Column parameter specifies the database column name used as an alternative key for identifying employees within the organization data synchronization process.

**Business Impact:**

Setting the Employee Alternative Key Column accurately is crucial for ensuring that employee records are correctly identified and matched across different HR data sources and systems. Misconfiguration could lead to inaccurate employee data synchronization, impacting HR operations and compliance reporting.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When correctly configured, this parameter ensures the effective matching and integration of employee data from various sources, facilitating accurate HR data synchronization and reporting. It helps in maintaining data integrity and consistency across the organization's HR and security systems.

**Examples Scenario:**

- An organization wishes to integrate their HR system with Pathlock GRC to automate access control based on roles and responsibilities. By correctly setting the Employee Alternative Key Column, the system can accurately match employee records with their roles in Pathlock GRC, streamlining access control processes.
