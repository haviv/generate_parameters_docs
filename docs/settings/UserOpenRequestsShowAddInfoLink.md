**Description:** This parameter controls the visibility of an additional information link within the User Open Requests page. When enabled, users can access more detailed information directly from their open requests.

**Business Impact:** Enabling this feature can significantly enhance user experience by providing immediate access to detailed request information, thereby reducing the time and effort required to manage and review open requests. It facilitates better decision-making for users by giving them complete insight into their requests without the need to navigate away from the current page.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When activated, this parameter adjusts the User Open Requests page to include a link to additional information. Technically, it toggles the visibility of user-specific details that could aid in the understanding or actionability of requests, directly influencing user engagement and administrative efficiency.

**Examples Scenario:** For instance, in an organization where users frequently manage multiple requests related to access rights, enabling this feature allows users to quickly view additional details about each request (e.g., request justification, detailed compliance information, or approval status) directly from the open requests page. This capability ensures that all necessary information is at the users' fingertips, enhancing their ability to make informed decisions swiftly.
