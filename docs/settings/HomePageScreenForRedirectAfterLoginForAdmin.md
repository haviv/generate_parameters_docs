**Home Page Screen For Redirect After Login For Admin**

**Technical Name:** HomePageScreenForRedirectAfterLoginForAdmin

**Category:** User Management

**Default Value:** StartPage.aspx

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:** Determines the initial page an administrator user is redirected to after successfully logging in. It's crucial for guiding admins to their designated landing page that could provide an overview of system health, pending tasks, or a dashboard of key metrics.

**Business Impact:** Optimizing this setting ensures that administrators are immediately presented with the most relevant information upon login, enhancing their ability to oversee and manage the system effectively. It aids in quick decision-making and prioritizing the administration tasks that require immediate attention.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When properly set, this parameter ensures a streamlined workflow by directly navigating administrator users to a landing page tailored to their roleâ€™s needs, possibly enhancing system security and operational efficiency by reducing the time to access critical information.

**Example Scenario:** If an organization wants to ensure that their IT security team immediately sees the security dashboard with key metrics and alerts as soon as they log in, they can set the `HomePageScreenForRedirectAfterLoginForAdmin` parameter to redirect to a custom security dashboard (e.g., `SecurityDashboard.aspx`).
