# Username Field In Custom Reports

**Technical Name:** UsernameFieldInCustomReports

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:** -1

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter controls the inclusion and behavior of the username field within custom reports generated by the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It specifies how user-related data should be filtered and presented, thereby impacting the report's granularity and privacy considerations.

**Business Impact:**

Proper configuration of this parameter ensures that reports are aligned with organizational standards for privacy, security, and compliance. It facilitates detailed audit trails and user activity tracking, which are crucial for internal audits and regulatory compliance. Incorrect settings can lead to either an overload of irrelevant information or a lack of sufficient detail for meaningful analysis.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Configuring this parameter correctly enables the platform to filter report data based on user-specific criteria. It essentially ensures that only relevant user data is displayed for the reports in question, supporting better decision-making and regulatory compliance efforts. A default value of "-1" implies a specific filtering logic or a fallback to a default behavior.

**Examples Scenario:**

A Pathlock administrator is tasked with generating a report that tracks the activities of users with privileged access within specific systems. By configuring the UsernameFieldInCustomReports parameter appropriately, they can ensure that the report precisely includes data for these selected users, thereby facilitating a focused review of privileged access utilization and potential abuse.

**Best Practices:** configure when needing detailed user-specific insights in reports, avoid when broad system-level reporting is sufficient without the need for user granularity.
