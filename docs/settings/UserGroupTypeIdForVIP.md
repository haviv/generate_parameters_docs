# User Group Type Id For VIP

**Technical Name:** UserGroupTypeIdForVIP

**Category:** User Management

**Default Value:** Not specified

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter configures specific user group types designated for VIPs within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It identifies the user group that contains VIP users, thereby assisting in tailor-made processes or policies for such user groups.

**Business Impact:**

Configuring the UserGroupTypeIdForVIP correctly ensures that VIPs within an organization are adequately segregated and managed, facilitating enhanced security measures and streamlined access control. This setting is crucial for organizations that require differentiated handling of VIP accounts in terms of access rights, workflows, and security policies.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Once set, the UserGroupTypeIdForVIP parameter directly influences how VIP users are recognized and managed within the system. This includes customized workflow actions, security policies, and bypasses that might be necessary for such prominent accounts, ensuring they receive the appropriate level of access and privileges across the organization's resources.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Scenario 1:** An organization wants to expedite approval processes for their VIPs, ensuring they gain quicker access to critical systems without compromising security. By setting the UserGroupTypeIdForVIP appropriately, the system can automatically prioritize and streamline workflows for user accounts classified under the VIP user group.
  
- **Scenario 2:** For enhanced security measures, an organization wishes to apply additional monitoring and audit policies exclusively to VIP accounts. Defining these accounts through the UserGroupTypeIdForVIP parameter enables the implementation of these specialized controls.

**Related Settings:** Not specified

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** Establishing clear distinctions between VIP user accounts and general user accounts is necessary to enforce special handling or workflow processes.
  
- **Avoid when:** If your organization does not differentiate between VIPs and other users in terms of access control and system privileges, configuring this parameter might introduce unnecessary complexity.
