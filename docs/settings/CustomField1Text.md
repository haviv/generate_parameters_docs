# Custom Field1 Text

**Technical Name:** CustomField1Text

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `CustomField1Text` parameter is designed for customizing and extending the capabilities of the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This parameter allows for the addition of custom text fields within various modules of the platform, enabling organizations to tailor the platform to their unique data capture and reporting needs.

**Business Impact:**

Incorporating `CustomField1Text` into your Pathlock Cloud GRC configuration can significantly enhance data management and reporting capabilities. By allowing for the customization of information fields, organizations can ensure that critical and specific data relevant to their security, risk, and compliance processes are captured and accessible. This could lead to more accurate risk assessments, better compliance reporting, and enhanced user management processes, directly impacting strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When `CustomField1Text` is properly configured, it provides a flexible means to capture information specific to an organization's operational or compliance requirements. This flexibility can enable more detailed tracking of changes, more refined user management practices, and the inclusion of company-specific data points for auditing purposes.

**Examples Scenario:**

- A company wants to track specific HR information related to employee job codes and their changes over time for compliance reasons. They can utilize `CustomField1Text` to create a dedicated field in the employee information module to record and track these job code changes.
  
- In a scenario where an organization requires tracking of specific custom client numbers within their central users' administration for internal audits, `CustomField1Text` can be utilized to add this custom field, ensuring that all required data points are captured systematically.

**Related Settings:**

- `AutomaticLockUserNeverLoggedInText`
- `AutomaticLockUserWorkflowActionId`

**Best Practices:** 

- **configure when:** there is a clear requirement for capturing specific information not available through standard Pathlock Cloud GRC fields. Custom fields should be designed to enhance data capture in alignment with compliance, security, or risk management strategies.
- **avoid when:** the required data can be captured using existing fields and modules within Pathlock Cloud GRC. Overuse of custom fields can lead to unnecessary complexity and potential confusion during data analysis and reporting stages.
