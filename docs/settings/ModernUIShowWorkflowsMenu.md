**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `ModernUIShowWorkflowsMenu` parameter controls the visibility of the Workflows Menu in the Modern UI of the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. When enabled, it provides users with access to a dedicated menu for managing and executing workflow actions, enhancing the platform's usability and efficiency in process management.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling this feature could significantly affect how users interact with the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform, making workflows more accessible and manageable. It facilitates smoother operation management, fostering a more streamlined approach to compliance, risk management, and security processes within the organization.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Once configured, the Workflows Menu will be visible and accessible to users on the Modern UI, enabling them to access, manage, and execute workflows directly from the main interface. This direct access can lead to improved efficiency in workflow management.

**Example Scenario:**

A compliance manager needs to regularly review and manage a series of compliance workflows to ensure the organization meets relevant regulatory standards. Enabling the `ModernUIShowWorkflowsMenu` allows the manager to access these workflows directly from the main menu, reducing the steps needed to navigate through the platform and thereby streamlining the compliance management process.

**Related Settings:**

- `UserPortalEnableChooseSystem`: Determines if users can choose the system they operate on within the User Portal.
- `RunSoDInMemory`: Controls whether Segregation of Duties (SoD) checks are executed in memory.

**Best Practices:** configure when you aim to enhance user experience and workflow accessibility, avoid when minimal UI complexity is desired or if there are concerns over users accessing certain workflow functionalities directly.
