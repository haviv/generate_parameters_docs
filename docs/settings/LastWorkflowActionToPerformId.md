# Last Workflow Action To Perform

**Technical Name:** LastWorkflowActionToPerformId

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

This parameter identifies the last action to be performed within a specific workflow, marked by its unique action ID. It's pivotal in orchestrating the sequence of actions in business processes, ensuring the correct execution order and maintaining integrity across transactions within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform.

**Business Impact:**

Setting the correct LastWorkflowActionToPerformId ensures that workflow processes conclude appropriately, safeguarding against premature termination or bypass of crucial compliance checks. It plays a crucial role in maintaining operational efficacy, adherence to compliance standards, and overseeing risk management procedures by enforcing a structured process flow.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Properly configuring this parameter ensures that workflows are executed seamlessly, with each action completed in its intended sequence. It also aids in tracking the progress and status of workflows, facilitating easier audit trails, troubleshooting, and optimization of business processes.

**Examples Scenario:**

For instance, in a compliance review process, the LastWorkflowActionToPerformId might signify the final approval step by a senior compliance officer after a series of preliminary reviews and checks have been cleared. This ensures that no compliance process is marked as complete without undergoing all mandated checks and approvals, fulfilling both internal and regulatory requirements.

**Related Settings:**

- WorkflowActionsToPerforms.Id (This is directly related as it corresponds to the specific action within a workflow that is being referenced as the last required action.)

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** Outlining a new workflow or amending an existing workflow to include new steps. It is crucial to update this parameter to reflect the final step accurately, ensuring the workflow completes as intended.
  
- **Avoid when:** There is uncertainty about the workflow's structure or when changes are ongoing. Configuring this parameter prematurely could disrupt the workflow's logic, leading to incomplete transactions or compliance oversights.
