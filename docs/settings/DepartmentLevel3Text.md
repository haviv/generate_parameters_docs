**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The DepartmentLevel3Text parameter is used to define the label or heading for the third level of department or business unit classification within the organization in the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This classification level allows for granular reporting and management of security, risk, and compliance data.

**Business Impact:**

Configuring this parameter enables organizations to map their unique hierarchical structures into the Pathlock platform, enhancing the accuracy of compliance reporting and security management. It ensures that reports and dashboard views can reflect the specific departmental breakdowns that exist within the organization, making it easier to identify risks, compliance issues, and security breaches at different levels of the business unit hierarchy.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, the DepartmentLevel3Text parameter affects how data is displayed and grouped in reports and dashboards. It enables the system to categorize and filter data based on the designated third-level business unit, facilitating targeted analysis and reporting. This categorization aids in isolating and addressing issues within specific segments of the organization, improving the efficiency of risk management and compliance efforts.

**Examples Scenario:**

An organization with a complex structure wants to ensure their risk and compliance reporting captures data at a granular level. They decide to use the DepartmentLevel3Text parameter to label their "Regional Offices" as the third level of business unit hierarchy. By doing so, they can generate reports that explicitly show compliance metrics and security risks at the regional office level, enabling targeted risk mitigation strategies and compliance initiatives.

**Best Practices:** Configure the DepartmentLevel3Text parameter to closely align with your organizationâ€™s structural hierarchy. Avoid using vague or overly general labels that do not accurately represent the intended level of departmental breakdown.
