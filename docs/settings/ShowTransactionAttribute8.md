**Category:** General - UI

**Default Value:** *Not provided in the provided code references.*

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** This parameter controls the visibility of the eighth transaction attribute in various user interfaces within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. When enabled, it allows for the display of specific transaction-related information, aiding in the detailed analysis and reporting of activities.

**Business Impact:** Enabling this feature can enhance the understanding of transactional data, providing insights necessary for effective decision-making. It supports compliance and audit processes by offering granular details on transactions, which can be critical for identifying potential risks or anomalies.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When activated, the system includes the eighth transaction attribute in relevant reports and UI elements, potentially increasing the information density for users. This can lead to more informed auditing and compliance checks but may require additional processing resources.

**Examples Scenario:** A company wishes to monitor high-risk transactions within its ERP system. By enabling ShowTransactionAttribute8, it can include a specific, often overlooked, transaction attribute in its monitoring reports. This could reveal patterns or details that are not visible without this attribute, leading to improved risk detection and mitigation strategies.
