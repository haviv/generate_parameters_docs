**Technical Name:** StartStepWithAutomaticActionsForeachUser

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** Not Specified

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The "Start Step With Automatic Actions Foreach User" parameter is designed to automate the initiation of workflows for each user based on specific roles within target systems. It utilizes the configuration of roles and systems as inputs to determine the automatic actions to be taken for each applicable user.

**Business Impact:**

Implementing this parameter efficiently streamlines the process of starting workflows for various users, significantly reducing manual intervention and ensuring that necessary compliance and organizational processes are initiated without delay. This automation can enhance compliance, reduce errors, and improve the overall effectiveness of the organization's GRC (Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance) strategies.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, this parameter automatically triggers the start of specific workflow steps for users based on their roles in particular systems. This ensures that all compliance, risk management, or audit-related actions required for those roles are automatically initiated, helping to maintain an up-to-date and compliant environment.

**Examples Scenario:**

Suppose an organization needs to ensure that all users with a specific role in their SAP system are automatically enrolled in a compliance training workflow at the start of each quarter. By setting up the "Start Step With Automatic Actions Foreach User" parameter, the system will automatically identify users with the specified roles and initiate the training workflow without manual setup for each user.
