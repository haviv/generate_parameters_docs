# Sap Table Read Buffer Size

**Technical Name:** SapTableReadBufferSize

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** 

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The SapTableReadBufferSize parameter controls the buffer size used for reading tables from the SAP system. Adjusting this parameter can optimize the performance of data retrieval operations, balancing between speed and resource usage.

**Business Impact:**

Proper configuration of this parameter impacts how efficiently the system fetches data from SAP tables. It can lead to performance improvements in data synchronization, reporting, and analytics, directly affecting the timeliness and accuracy of compliance and risk assessment reports.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Configuring SapTableReadBufferSize appropriately can reduce load times and improve the responsiveness of the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform when accessing large sets of data from SAP. It helps in managing system resources by preventing overallocation or underutilization.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **For Large Data Fetches:** When the system is required to fetch large volumes of data frequently, increasing the buffer size can reduce the number of round-trips to the SAP system, speeding up the process.
  
- **During High Load Periods:** Reducing the buffer size during times of high system load can help alleviate stress on network and system resources, avoiding performance bottlenecks.

**Related Settings:** 

- `UpdateCachePeriod`

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** There is a need to optimize the performance of data fetching operations, specifically for large data sets or during peak usage times.
  
- **Avoid when:** The default settings align with the typical use cases and performance is satisfactory; unnecessary adjustments could lead to resource inefficiency or other issues.
