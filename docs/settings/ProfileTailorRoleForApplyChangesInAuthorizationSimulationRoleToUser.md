# Pathlock Role For Apply Changes in Role to User

**Technical Name:** ProfileTailorRoleForApplyChangesInAuthorizationSimulationRoleToUser

**Category:** User Management

**Default Value:** Not specified

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter is utilized within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to manage and apply role changes directly to users during the authorization simulation process. It specifies the criteria or the role settings that need to be considered when simulating changes to user permissions or access rights within the system.

**Business Impact:**

The proper configuration of this parameter ensures that role changes are efficiently and securely applied to users, aligning with the organization's security, compliance, and governance policies. It impacts how smoothly and securely modifications in user roles are reflected, potentially affecting operational efficiency and compliance with regulatory requirements.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- Efficient simulation of changes to user roles, ensuring that only authorized adjustments are applied.
- Enhanced security posture by ensuring that role changes do not inadvertently grant excessive permissions.
- Improved compliance with internal and external audit and governance requirements by maintaining a tight control over role assignments.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Before Implementing Changes:** An administrator needs to apply a new role to a user but wants to ensure compatibility with existing permissions and compliance with SOD (Segregation of Duties) policies. The administrator simulates the role assignment using this parameter to foresee any potential conflicts or excessive permissions.
- **After Implementing Changes:** The simulation highlights a potential SOD conflict, enabling the administrator to adjust the role permissions before applying them, thus ensuring compliance and security.

**Best Practices:** Configure when simulating role changes to forecast potential security or compliance issues. Avoid when direct changes without simulation are certain to align with all compliance requirements and do not pose a security risk.
