**Technical Name:** AuthorizationReviewSystemDetailsLinkUrl

**Category:** Authorization Review

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** This setting configures the URL to detailed information or a dashboard that provides further insights or actions related to authorization review processes within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform.

**Business Impact:** Proper configuration enhances the authorization review process by facilitating quick access to detailed authorization data, improving decision-making efficiency, audit trails, and compliance monitoring. It streamlines the workflow for auditors, compliance officers, and IT security teams by providing instant access to in-depth information, potentially reducing the time and effort required for authorization reviews and audits.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When correctly configured, it directly affects the ease of access to detailed authorization review data, leading to more informed and quicker decision-making processes. It can also contribute to a more efficient compliance and security management workflow by embedding relevant direct links within the authorization review interfaces.

**Examples Scenario:** For instance, if a security manager is reviewing authorization roles within the platform, this setting can provide them directly link to a detailed page containing historical access data, role assignments, and compliance reports for those roles. This facilitates a deeper analysis without the need to manually search for this information, thus speeding up the authorization review process.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** You have a dedicated dashboard or webpage that provides detailed insights into authorization setups, role definitions, user assignments, and compliance status that can aid in the review process.
- **Avoid when:** If the link leads to general information that does not specifically aid in the authorization review process or if the detailed link is not routinely updated, as stale or irrelevant information might hinder decision-making.
