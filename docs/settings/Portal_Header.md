**Technical Name:** Portal_Header

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The Portal_Header parameter is used to configure the main title displayed on the portal homepage within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This title is pivotal in guiding users and providing contextual understanding of the portal's current focus or functionality. It can be customized to suit the organizational branding or to highlight specific governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) functionalities.

**Business Impact:**

A well-configured Portal_Header enhances user experience by providing clear, direct communication about the portal's content and purpose. It aids in navigation and orientation within the platform, reducing confusion and improving efficiency in accessing critical GRC information and tools.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When the Portal_Header is configured, it changes the displayed title on the main page of the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This can affect user recognition and interaction with the platform, emphasizing specific aspects of the platform according to the organization's current focus or needs.

**Examples Scenario:**

- A company going through an audit may configure the Portal_Header to "Compliance Dashboard" to emphasize the compliance status and reports.
- After the audit, the same company might change the Portal_Header to "Risk Management Overview" to shift focus towards managing and mitigating risks.

**Related Settings:**

- `NotificationSettings`: Relates to the notifications system in the portal, can be relevant to highlight alongside the main title.
- `Parameters`: Indicates other parameters that can be configured within the platform for a tailored experience.

**Best Practices:** 

Configure when:
- Re-branding the platform to align with corporate identity.
- Shifting focus towards different aspects of GRC as per organizational priorities.

Avoid when:
- Constant changes might confuse users.
- The chosen title is too vague or misleading, hindering rather than aiding navigation and comprehension.
