This external table is utilized by the ExternalTableHRProvider to integrate external HR data into the Pathlock environment, enabling enhanced organization structure management capabilities.

**Business Impact:**

Configuring this parameter correctly ensures that HR data from external systems can be seamlessly integrated into Pathlock, enhancing the accuracy of compliance, risk analysis, and security management by utilizing up-to-date and comprehensive organizational data.

**Examples Scenario:**

A company uses an external HR management system to store all employee data, including roles, departments, and locations. By configuring `HRDataSourceForExternalTableName` to point to the specific external database table containing this data, Pathlock can directly utilize this external information for compliance checks, role-based access controls, and risk assessments, ensuring that all decisions and policies are based on the most current HR data.
