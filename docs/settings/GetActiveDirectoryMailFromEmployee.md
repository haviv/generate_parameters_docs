It ensures that user information within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform remains consistent with the organization's primary directory services.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Security Notifications:** Automatically sending out notifications to employees' email addresses retrieved from Active Directory regarding password changes, access rights alterations, or compliance breaches.

Avoid when organizations use a different primary source for employee email addresses or when Active Directory is not regularly updated with current employee information.
