# Show Authorization Field In Role Usage

**Technical Name:** ShowAuthorizationFieldInRoleUsage

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:** Not Provided

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The "Show Authorization Field In Role Usage" parameter controls the visibility of authorization fields in role usage reporting. This feature is crucial for comprehensively understanding the roles within an organization and how they're utilized, especially in scenarios necessitating a deeper analysis of role-based access controls.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling this parameter allows organizations to gain detailed insights into the authorization aspects of role usage. It facilitates improved audit and compliance processes by ensuring that all elements of a role, including specific authorizations, are transparent and reportable. This visibility is essential for identifying potentially overprivileged roles and adhering to the principle of least privilege, thereby reducing security risks.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Once this parameter is configured to show the authorization field, reports such as the Role Usage Percentage Report and the Total Usage Report will include detailed authorization data. This enhances the reports' utility by providing a more granular view of role assignments and usage within the system, allowing for better informed decision-making and risk assessment.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Audit Preparation:** Ahead of an external audit, the GRC team configures this parameter to ensure authorization data is visible in role usage reports. This allows auditors to verify that users have appropriate access levels, helping to demonstrate compliance with access control standards.
  
- **Security Review:** During a periodic security assessment, the IT security team leverages this feature to identify roles with excessively broad authorizations that could pose a risk if exploited.

**Related Settings:** Not Provided

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** Preparing for audits or compliance assessments to ensure visibility into all aspects of role usage.
  
- **Avoid when:** The inclusion of authorization details in reports may lead to information overload or may not be necessary for all reporting contexts, especially in environments where role configurations are already tightly controlled and monitored.
