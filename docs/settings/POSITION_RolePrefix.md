**Technical Name:** POSITION_RolePrefix

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** None

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:** Identifies a prefix used to filter or categorize roles based on their associated position within an organization, enhancing role management and access control within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform.

**Business Impact:** Ensures that role assignments and access controls are accurately aligned with organizational structure and positions, facilitating better governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) practices.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When configured, this parameter enables the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to selectively include or exclude roles based on their prefix, directly affecting user access permissions and role-based access controls (RBAC). This can significantly impact the security posture and compliance reporting of the organization.

**Example Scenario:** If the `POSITION_RolePrefix` is set to "FIN_" for finance roles, only roles prefixed with "FIN_" would be considered during access rights evaluation for finance department positions, simplifying role management and ensuring that only relevant roles are assigned to users based on their position.

**Best Practices:** 
- **Configure when:** implementing precise role-based access controls is required to align with organizational roles and structures.
- **Avoid when:** roles in the organization do not have a standardized naming convention or when such granularity in access control is not necessary.
