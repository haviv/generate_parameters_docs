# Events Summary Mail - Formatted Footer

**Technical Name:** DailyEmailFormatedFooter

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `DailyEmailFormatedFooter` parameter allows users to customize the footer content in the daily events summary email. This parameter is designed to enhance the readability and informational value of automated reports by appending a formatted footer.

**Business Impact:**

Customizing the email footer allows for the inclusion of essential business information, disclaimers, or contact details. This addition can improve communication clarity with stakeholders and ensure that recipients have all necessary information for taking appropriate actions or making informed decisions.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When this parameter is configured, the default footer in the daily events summary email sent from the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform is replaced with the user-defined content. This enables better branding and messaging consistency across organization communications.

**Examples Scenario:**

A company may want to add a custom footer to their daily events summary emails that include a disclaimer about the confidentiality of the information, a custom message reminding employees of their data handling policies, or contact information for the IT department for any queries regarding the report content.

**Best Practices:** Configure when you need to include specific legal disclaimers, corporate contact information, or to maintain brand consistency. Avoid custom configurations that add unnecessary length or potentially confusing information to the footer.
