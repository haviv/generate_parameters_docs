# Disable Comments Section In Config Screens

**Technical Name:** DisableCommentsSectionInConfigScreens

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** False

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter controls the visibility of the comments section across various configuration screens within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. When enabled, the comments fields will not be displayed, streamlining the interface and focusing the user on essential configuration elements.

**Business Impact:**

Disabling the comments section can lead to a more streamlined configuration process by reducing clutter on the screen. However, it may also impact the ability to provide contextual information or explanations about specific configurations, which could be useful for audit trails or for new team members familiarizing themselves with the system settings.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When this parameter is set to true, all comments fields are hidden from the configuration screens, potentially impacting how users interact with these screens by removing their ability to view or enter supplementary information.

**Examples Scenario:**

Suppose a company has a stringent policy regarding screen simplicity to ensure that their IT department manages GRC configurations without distractions or unnecessary options. By enabling `DisableCommentsSectionInConfigScreens`, they can ensure that their staff focuses solely on the relevant configuration options, thus adhering to their policy of simplicity and potentially reducing the time spent on configurations.
