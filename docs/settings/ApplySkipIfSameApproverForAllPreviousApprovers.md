# Apply Skip If Same Approver For All Previous Approvers

**Technical Name:** ApplySkipIfSameApproverForAllPreviousApprovers

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** 

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

Determines if the workflow step should be skipped when the current approver is the same as all previous approvers in the workflow sequence. This parameter is utilized during the workflow execution process to ensure efficiency and prevent unnecessary approval steps when the approver remains unchanged throughout the process.

**Business Impact:**

Implementing this parameter can significantly streamline workflow processes by eliminating redundant approval steps. This can lead to faster completion times for workflows, reduced workload for approvers, and overall improved efficiency in processes requiring approvals within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When activated, this setting performs a check before executing an approval step.  If it identifies that the current approver has already approved the previous steps in the workflow, it will automatically skip the current approval step and proceed to the next step in the workflow sequence. This mechanism is particularly effective in scenarios where a tiered approval process is not strictly necessary, or where a single individual holds multiple roles within the approval chain.

**Examples Scenario:**

Consider a scenario where a financial report requires approval from several departments before publication. However, due to a streamlined management structure, the same senior manager is responsible for approvals across these departments. With `ApplySkipIfSameApproverForAllPreviousApprovers` enabled, once the manager approves the report at the initial stage, subsequent steps designated for them to approve in their other capacities are automatically skipped, thus expediting the report's approval process.

**Best Practices:** configure when

- You have workflows that frequently encounter scenarios where the same approver is responsible for multiple consecutive steps.
- The workflow does not require strict sequential approval for integrity or compliance reasons.

avoid when

- Every step in the workflow is crucial to be explicitly approved by the approver, even if it's the same person, for audit trail or compliance reasons.
