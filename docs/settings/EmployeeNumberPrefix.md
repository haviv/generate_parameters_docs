# Employee Number Prefix

**Technical Name:** EmployeeNumberPrefix

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Low

**Description:**

The Employee Number Prefix parameter is used to configure a prefix for employee numbers within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This setting helps in the identification and segregation of employee records across various departments or geographical locations.

**Business Impact:**

This parameter, when configured, allows organizations to maintain a systematic approach to employee numbering, aiding in easier identification, sorting, and record management. It supports the enforcement of standardized HR and employee management practices.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- Ensures employee numbers are unique and easily identifiable.
- Aids in preventing record duplication.
- Facilitates smoother integration with external HR and ERP systems by maintaining consistent employee identifiers.

**Example Scenario:**

A multinational corporation with operations in multiple countries can use the Employee Number Prefix parameter to prepend country initials to employee numbers, such as "US-12345" for an employee working in the United States or "DE-12345" for an employee in Germany. This makes it easier to identify employeesâ€™ base locations just by looking at their employee number.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:**
  - Implementing or updating the organizational structure requires clear identification of employees across different regions or departments.
  - There are multiple HR systems in use within the organization, necessitating a unified approach to employee numbering.

- **Avoid when:**
  - The organization has a small number of employees, and adding a prefix could complicate the employee identification process unnecessarily.
  - The current employee numbering system is sufficient and does not lead to any conflicts or confusion.
