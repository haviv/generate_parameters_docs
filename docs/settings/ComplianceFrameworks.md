# Compliance Frameworks

**Technical Name:** ComplianceFrameworks

**Category:** Compliance

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

The Compliance Frameworks parameter is designed to support the configuration and management of compliance related data within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This parameter allows for the adjustment and setting of compliance frameworks applicable to the organization's needs, assisting in aligning security policies and procedures with specific regulatory and compliance requirements.

**Business Impact:**

Effective management of Compliance Frameworks ensures that the organization remains in compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and standards, thus reducing the risk of legal penalties, fines, and loss of reputation. It facilitates ongoing compliance efforts by streamlining processes related to risk assessment, audit management, and compliance reporting.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When this parameter is properly configured, it impacts the system by enabling the customization and application of specific compliance requirements directly into the security and risk management workflows of the organization. This facilitates a more focused and efficient approach to compliance, where activities are aligned with the compliance frameworks relevant to the organization.

**Examples Scenario:**

- An organization subject to GDPR and HIPAA could configure the Compliance Frameworks parameter to reflect these specific requirements, ensuring that data protection and privacy laws are met.
- A financial institution could apply compliance frameworks related to SOX and Basel III, integrating these into their compliance tracking and reporting within the platform.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when** setting up the platform for the first time or whenever there are changes to compliance obligations due to changes in business operations, jurisdiction, or applicable laws.
- **Avoid when** the organization does not have a clear understanding of its compliance requirements or when there is a lack of resources to manage and maintain the selected frameworks.
