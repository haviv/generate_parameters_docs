**Portal - Show top banner**

**Technical Name:** Portal_ShowProductHeader

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** 

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter controls the visibility of the top banner within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. Enabling this feature will display a banner at the top of the portal, which may be used for navigation, announcements, or highlighting important information to users.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling the top banner can significantly enhance user navigation and provide a centralized location for broadcasting essential updates or alerts to all platform users. This can lead to improved user engagement and ensure critical information is prominently displayed.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- When enabled, a top banner will be displayed across the portal.
- Aesthetics of the portal can be modified to align with corporate branding or highlight specific governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) initiatives.
- Potentially impacts page load times if extensive content is placed within the banner.

**Examples Scenario:**

A company implements the Portal_ShowProductHeader parameter to showcase upcoming audit dates, compliance deadlines, or system-wide announcements directly on the top banner of their Pathlock Cloud GRC platform, ensuring all users are immediately made aware of these critical dates upon logging into the portal.
