**Description:**

Parameter defines a text label for the second level of departmental detail within the organization's structure, used to categorize and identify employees' departmental affiliations at a secondary level.

**Business Impact:**

Facilitates fine-grained access control, reporting, and user management by allowing organizations to organize and manage permissions, responsibilities, and workflow processes with greater specificity according to departmental structures at a secondary level.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Enhances the system's capacity to filter, report, and manage users based on more precise organizational units beyond the primary departmental level, aiding in the efficient assignment of roles and permissions.

**Example Scenario:**

An organization wants to assign specific access rights to users within a large department. By utilizing the DepartmentLevel2Text parameter, the organization can further categorize employees into secondary departments or units, making it easier to manage access controls and assign specific rights based on the finer departmental breakdown.
