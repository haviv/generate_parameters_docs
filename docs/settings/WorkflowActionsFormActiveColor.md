# Workflow Actions Form Active Color

**Technical Name:** WorkflowActionsFormActiveColor

**Category:** Workflow UI

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** This parameter specifies the color used to highlight active elements within workflow action forms in the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It is instrumental in enhancing the user interface by making it easier to identify active vs. inactive elements during workflow configuration or execution.

**Business Impact:** Setting an appropriate color for active elements in workflow forms improves user experience and reduces the risk of configuration errors. It ensures that users can efficiently navigate and complete required actions within workflows, thereby supporting compliance and risk management activities.

**Technical Impact when configured:** Configuring this parameter changes the visual representation of active elements on workflow action forms, aiding users in quickly identifying fields that require their attention. This can have a direct impact on the usability of the platform, potentially influencing the effectiveness of compliance and risk management processes.

**Examples Scenario:** 

- If the default color scheme of a workflow form blends too closely with the platform's background or other elements, users might struggle to notice which fields are active and require input. Adjusting the WorkflowActionsFormActiveColor to a brighter or more contrasting color can make active elements stand out, reducing the time taken to complete forms and minimizing errors.

**Best Practices:** 
- **Configure when:** You need to enhance form usability and distinction among active and inactive elements, especially in complex workflows where visual cues are crucial for navigation.
- **Avoid when:** The selected color conflicts with the platform's overall color scheme, leading to a decrease in usability or accessibility issues for users with visual impairments.
