# Is Trial Version

**Technical Name:** IsTrialVersion

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** 

**Impact Level:** Low

**Description:**

The 'Is Trial Version' parameter plays a crucial role in configuring the operational mode of the Pathlock GRC platform. It determines whether the software is operating in a trial mode, which often has limitations compared to the full-functioning version.

**Business Impact:**

Configuring this parameter as true could limit certain functionalities within the platform, affecting how users can interact with different modules. For instance, it might restrict access to full data analysis capabilities, advanced reporting features, or custom workflows that are essential for managing security, risk, and compliance more effectively. As a result, users operating under a trial version might not experience the platform's full capabilities, potentially impacting decision-making processes and risk assessments.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Setting 'Is Trial Version' to true typically engages a specific mode in the software where certain features are either restricted or fully disabled. This setting is crucial for organizations evaluating the software before a full deployment or purchase. It influences resource allocation, access levels, and the availability of advanced features, hence affecting both the user experience and the platform's performance in tackling complex GRC challenges.

**Example Scenario:**

A company is evaluating Pathlock GRC to enhance its compliance strategies. By configuring the platform to the trial version, they aim to explore its functionalities and assess its fit with existing processes. However, this limits their access to certain advanced risk assessment tools, leading to a compromised evaluation process where the tool's full potential isn't adequately explored.

**Best Practices:** 

- Configure when: Conducting an initial evaluation of the Pathlock GRC software to understand its core capabilities without the need for full feature access.
  
- Avoid when: Conducting in-depth assessments or when full platform capabilities are essential for comprehensive GRC management during the trial phase.
