# Minimum Time Diff Between To Uses Of The Same Transaction By The Same User In Minutes

**Technical Name:** MinimumTimeDiffBetweenToUsesOfTheSameTransactionByTheSameUserInMinutes

**Category:** Security

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

This parameter defines the minimum time difference required between two uses of the same transaction by the same user. It ensures users do not perform the same transaction within a configured timeframe, enhancing security by preventing rapid, repeated transactions which could indicate fraudulent or unintended activity.

**Business Impact:**

Setting an appropriate value for this parameter helps prevent abuse of system transactions, reduces the risk of fraudulent activities, and enhances the overall security posture of an organization. It ensures that transactions are performed with due consideration, supporting audit trails' integrity and compliance requirements.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, this parameter enforces a mandatory wait time between identical transactions by the same user, reducing the likelihood of duplicate entries or errors. It also aids in monitoring and controlling the sequence of transactions, thus aiding in security audits and compliance with internal or regulatory standards.

**Example Scenario:**

If the parameter is set to 30 minutes, and a user completes a financial posting transaction, that user must wait for at least 30 minutes before they can perform the same financial posting transaction again. This limits the ability to rapidly submit potentially fraudulent or erroneous transactions.

- `ReadChangeDocumentWhenDetectingDynamicSodViolation`

**Best Practices:** configure when you wish to add an additional layer of security to sensitive or critical transactions, to prevent abuse. Avoid setting this too low on frequently used transactions where such controls could hinder regular business operations.
