# Custom Authentication Provider

**Technical Name:** CustomAuthenticationProvider 

**Category:** Security

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

The Custom Authentication Provider parameter allows for the integration of an external authentication system with the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This feature enables organizations to implement their own authentication mechanisms beyond the standard offerings, providing flexibility and control over the login process and user verification.

**Business Impact:**

Implementing a custom authentication provider can significantly enhance security measures by allowing organizations to adopt more robust or specific authentication mechanisms tailored to their security requirements. It also facilitates compliance with internal policies or regulatory standards that mandate specific authentication procedures.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- Custom authentication logic can be applied, enabling the use of tokens, external identity providers, or proprietary authentication systems.
- Security is enhanced by allowing for more complex and potentially multi-factor authentication processes.
- Flexibility in adapting to evolving security requirements without depending on the platform's built-in authentication updates.

**Examples Scenario:**

An organization requires that all application logins undergo a two-step verification process that includes a dynamic token generated by an in-house app. By configuring the CustomAuthenticationProvider, they can integrate this process into their use of the Pathlock platform, ensuring all user logins meet this security requirement.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:**
  - You require authentication mechanisms not natively supported by Pathlock.
  - Enhanced security measures are needed that tailor to specific organizational policies or compliance requirements.
- **Avoid when:**
  - The built-in authentication systems meet your organization's security requirements, to avoid unnecessary complexity.
  - There is insufficient technical expertise to maintain and update the custom authentication mechanism safely.
