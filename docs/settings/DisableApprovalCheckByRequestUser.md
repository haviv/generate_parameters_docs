**Disable Approval Check By Request User**

**Technical Name:** DisableApprovalCheckByRequestUser

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** True

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `DisableApprovalCheckByRequestUser` parameter controls whether approval checks are performed for users submitting requests. When enabled, it bypasses approval checks for the request submitter, sending an approval email directly to the administrator if the user does not have an assigned approval group or when no email recipients are defined in the workflow settings.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling this feature can streamline certain workflows by reducing the number of approval steps, thus accelerating the time to complete tasks. However, it may also lead to scenarios where requests are not adequately reviewed, potentially affecting system security and compliance.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- Bypasses the approval step for the request submitter, potentially reducing oversight.
- Automatically defaults to administrator approval in scenarios where the requester has no assigned approval group or no recipients are defined, centralizing decision-making.
- Affects email notification flows by altering the recipient in certain conditions.

**Example Scenario:**

In a scenario where an organization wants to fast-track certain types of requests, such as access to non-sensitive resources, enabling this parameter can reduce the bureaucratic overhead. For instance, instead of going through multiple levels of approval for a routine access request, the submission can directly reach an administrator, speeding up the process.

**Best Practices:** 

- Configure when: Time-sensitive workflows require streamlined processing, and the risk associated with bypassing additional approval checks is deemed low.
- Avoid when: The integrity of the approval process is critical for security, compliance, or operational reasons.
