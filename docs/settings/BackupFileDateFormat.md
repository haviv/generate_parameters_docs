**Backup File Date Format**

**Technical Name:** BackupFileDateFormat

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** "C:\\Program Files\\Pathlock\\Backups"

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The Backup File Date Format parameter specifies the format used for naming backup files within the Pathlock platform. This parameter determines how backup filenames are constructed, primarily focusing on the incorporation of date formats to organize and identify backup files efficiently.

**Business Impact:**

Proper configuration of the Backup File Date Format is crucial for maintaining an organized backup system, which directly impacts the ability to quickly locate and restore specific backups when needed. Misconfiguration can lead to confusion, difficulty in identifying the correct backups, and potential delays in recovery processes during critical times.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When correctly configured, the Backup File Date Format supports the creation of consistently named backup files, enhancing automated and manual backup management processes. It aids in simplifying backup identification, sorting, and retrieval by embedding meaningful date-based information within the file names.

**Examples Scenario:**

For example, setting the Backup File Date Format to "YYYYMMDD" would result in backup files named with the precise date of creation, such as "20231201.reg" for a backup created on December 1st, 2023. This clear, date-oriented naming convention supports straightforward identification and organization of backup files.
