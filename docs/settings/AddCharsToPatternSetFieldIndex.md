# Add Chars To Pattern Set Field Index

**Technical Name:** AddCharsToPatternSetFieldIndex

**Category:** User Management

**Default Value:** None specified

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter is utilized in the context of generating and ensuring the uniqueness of usernames within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform's user creation service. It specifically influences the process by enabling the addition of characters to a pattern set which is then applied to the indexing of field values during the generation of usernames.

**Business Impact:**

Accurate and unique username generation is crucial for managing user identities in a secure and compliant manner. This parameter impacts the system's ability to prevent duplicate usernames, which is essential for access control, auditing, and risk management. It ensures that each user is distinctly identified, facilitating smoother onboarding and system access processes.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When this parameter is configured, it modifies the algorithm responsible for username generation by appending characters to the specified pattern set and field index. This adjustment enhances the uniqueness of the resultant usernames, particularly in large organizations or systems with a high volume of user accounts, by broadening the range of potential username combinations.

**Examples Scenario:**

In a scenario where the default username pattern generation leads to potential duplicates due to a high volume of common names within the organization, configuring this parameter to add additional characters to the pattern set's field index can significantly reduce the chances of duplication. For instance, adding departmental initials or a numeric sequence can help in creating distinct and unique usernames:

- Default pattern without additional chars: `john.smith`
- Enhanced pattern with additional chars: `john.smith.it01`

**Related Settings:** None specified

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** There is a high likelihood of username duplication within the system, or when organizational policies require highly specific or structured username formats.
- **Avoid when:** The existing username generation policies and patterns suffice in maintaining uniqueness and compliance with organizational naming conventions. Unnecessary complexity in username patterns may lead to confusion or errors in user onboarding and management processes.
