**Description:**

This parameter is designed to track and record the history of User Access Review (UAR) provisions in the Campaigns Review Details tab within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It ensures a transparent and audit-friendly log of changes or provisions applied during user access reviews in authorization campaigns.

**Business Impact:**

Activating the CampaignsReviewDetailsTabUAR_ProvisionHistory parameter will enable the organization to present a detailed history of all changes, supporting compliance and audit requirements.
