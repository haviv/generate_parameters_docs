# Show Role Type Column

**Technical Name:** ShowRoleTypeColumn

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:** Not Specified

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The "Show Role Type Column" parameter controls the visibility of the Role Type column in various report outputs within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. When enabled, this setting allows users to view the 'Role Type' column, which can distinguish between different role categories such as "Critical Role" within the reporting interface.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling this feature can significantly enhance understanding and management of role types across the organization's GRC (Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance) framework. It allows for a deeper analysis and segregation of roles based on their criticality and function, aiding in better decision-making and risk analysis.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Upon configuration, reports generated within the system will include a "Role Type" column, allowing users to view and assess roles based on specific criteria such as their criticality (e.g., "Critical Role"). This addition aids in providing a granular view of the roles, enhancing the effectiveness of GRC activities.

**Examples Scenario:**

A compliance officer could utilize the "Show Role Type Column" parameter when generating access review reports. By having the "Role Type" visible, the officer can quickly identify critical roles that may require more stringent review and control procedures, thus prioritizing their efforts towards roles with higher compliance and security implications.

**Related Settings:** Not Specified

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** A detailed analysis of roles within reports is required, particularly in environments where understanding the distinction between different types of roles (e.g., critical and non-critical) is crucial for compliance and security management.
- **Avoid when:** Simplicity in reports is desired, or when the distinction between different role types does not significantly impact the organization's risk or compliance posture.
