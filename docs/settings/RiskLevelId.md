**Risk Level**

**Technical Name:** RiskLevelId

**Category:** Risk

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**
The RiskLevelId parameter is used to define the level of risk associated with specific operations or organizational units within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It allows organizations to categorize their risk levels, facilitating more targeted risk management and compliance strategies.

**Business Impact:**
By accurately configuring the RiskLevelId, organizations can prioritize their security, compliance, and risk management efforts based on the categorization of risk levels. This ensures that high-risk areas receive more attention and resources, thereby reducing the potential for security breaches and compliance violations.

**Technical Impact when configured:**
When the RiskLevelId is properly set up, the system can automatically apply the appropriate risk mitigation strategies and compliance protocols. This enhances the organization's ability to safeguard sensitive information and maintain compliance with various regulatory requirements.

**Examples Scenario:**
If an organization identifies a process involving the transfer of sensitive customer data as high risk, by assigning a high RiskLevelId to this operation, they can ensure that enhanced security measures are automatically enforced.

**Best Practices:** 
- Configure the RiskLevelId for all operations and organizational units to ensure comprehensive risk management across the organization.
- Avoid assigning the same RiskLevelId to all operations; instead, accurately assess the risk associated with each operation to apply the most appropriate risk management strategies.
