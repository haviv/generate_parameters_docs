# DBMax Date

**Technical Name:** DBMaxDate

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:** Not provided in the references.

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:** The DBMaxDate parameter defines the maximum allowable date for database entries in reports and data extractions within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This setting ensures data relevance and integrity by filtering out records beyond a specified date.

**Business Impact:** Setting an appropriate DBMaxDate is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and relevance of GRC (Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance) reporting. It helps in excluding outdated or irrelevant data, facilitating better decision-making and ensuring compliance with various regulatory standards.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When configured, the DBMaxDate parameter filters out database entries later than the specified maximum date from reports and data extractions. This action improves performance by eliminating the processing of unnecessary data and enhances report accuracy by focusing on the relevant time frame.

**Examples Scenario:**

- To ensure compliance with financial reporting requirements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, an organization sets the DBMaxDate to December 31, 2022. This configuration excludes all transactions and data entries from 2023 and onwards, ensuring the reports only contain data relevant to the specified fiscal year.

**Related Settings:** 

- `GetDBMinValue()`: A related setting that defines the minimum allowable date for database entries, ensuring data is not older than a specific date.

**Best Practices:** 

- Configure when: It is essential to limit the data analysis and reporting to a specific date range for accuracy, performance, or compliance reasons.
- Avoid when: Data from all time periods must be included in analysis and reporting, with no need to exclude more recent data entries.
