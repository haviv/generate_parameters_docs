**Active Directory User Provision Fallback Mode**

**Technical Name:** ActiveDirectoryUserProvisionFallbackMode

**Category:** User Management

**Default Value:** ""

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:** The Active Directory User Provision Fallback Mode parameter is used to specify the behavior of the system when there is an issue connecting to the Active Directory (AD) server during user provisioning processes.

**Business Impact:** Proper configuration of this parameter ensures that user provisioning can continue in a defined manner when direct connection to the AD server is not possible, thereby minimizing disruptions in user access and maintaining operational continuity.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When configured, this setting determines the fallback mechanism or alternative approach the system should use if it encounters difficulties connecting to the AD server, such as attempting to connect through an alternative path or server.

**Examples Scenario:**
- A new employee is being onboarded, and their user account provisioning to the AD fails due to a network issue. With a fallback mode configured, the system could retry the operation using a predefined alternative connection method or queue the task for later execution, ensuring the user gets necessary access without manual intervention.

**Related Settings:**
- `OpenID_RegistrationEndpoint`: Might influence how user information is fetched during provisioning if fallback requires alternative authentication methods.

**Best Practices:** 
- **Configure when:** You have a complex network environment where AD connectivity issues are foreseeable, or you manage a large number of user accounts that need to be provisioned without delay.
- **Avoid when:** Your network infrastructure is highly stable and direct AD connectivity issues are virtually nonexistent, as unnecessary fallbacks could complicate user provisioning workflows.
