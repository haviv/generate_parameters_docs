**Technical Name:** TransactionAttribute8ColumnHeader

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `TransactionAttribute8ColumnHeader` parameter is designed for use within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to define and customize the header title for the eighth attribute column in transaction-related reports and dashboards. This customization allows for a more tailored and informative presentation of transaction data, which is critical for audit, monitoring, and compliance purposes.

**Business Impact:**

Proper configuration of this parameter ensures that reports generated for compliance, audit, and monitoring purposes accurately reflect the specific data fields relevant to the organization's internal control frameworks and regulatory requirements. This enhances the clarity and relevance of reports, facilitating better decision-making by management regarding risk, security, and compliance matters.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Once configured, the `TransactionAttribute8ColumnHeader` will affect how transaction data is displayed in the reports, replacing the default column header with a user-specified title. This customization directly influences the usability and readability of the reports, making them more intuitive for end-users and stakeholders who rely on this data for critical business decisions.

**Example Scenario:**

- A financial institution must adhere to stringent compliance regulations requiring detailed tracking of transactional data. By configuring the `TransactionAttribute8ColumnHeader` to "Approval Level," the institution can clearly display necessary compliance information directly in the transaction report, assisting in both internal and external audits.

**Related Settings:**

- TransactionAttribute4ColumnHeader
- TransactionAttribute5ColumnHeader
- TransactionAttribute6ColumnHeader

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** There is a need to customize report columns to match specific organizational reporting requirements or when default column names are not descriptive enough for the report consumers.
  
- **Avoid when:** Default settings already meet the organization's reporting needs, or if changes might cause confusion due to lack of communication about the alterations to end users.
