# SoD Simulate For Authorization Sets

**Technical Name:** SoDSimulateForAuthorizationSets

**Category:** SOD

**Default Value:** None specified

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

The `SoDSimulateForAuthorizationSets` parameter is designed to enable simulation capabilities for authorization sets within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This parameter facilitates the analysis of potential segregation of duties (SoD) conflicts by allowing simulations based on various authorization set configurations.

**Business Impact:**

Configuring this parameter correctly is crucial for preventing unauthorized access and potential fraud within an organization. By simulating the impact of different authorization set configurations, businesses can proactively identify and mitigate SoD conflicts, ensuring that internal controls are effective and compliant with regulatory requirements.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Once enabled, the `SoDSimulateForAuthorizationSets` parameter significantly enhances the platform's capacity to forecast and analyze the consequences of specific authorization sets on SoD policies. This proactive measure allows for the early detection of potential SoD conflicts, thereby facilitating prompt remedial action.

**Examples Scenario:**

A company implements a new financial approval process within their ERP system, requiring dual approval for transactions above a certain threshold. By using the `SoDSimulateForAuthorizationSets` parameter, the company can simulate various authorization set combinations to ensure that no single employee has the authority to both initiate and approve high-value transactions, thus maintaining strict internal controls and mitigating fraud risk.

**Related Settings:**

- `SodResolverConfig_UseSapRoles` signifies the roles allowed in solutions, relevant in determining the specific configurations for SoD simulation.
- `ImportManagersToWFBasedOnDirectManagerField` although more indirectly related, impacts workflow configurations which can influence SoD authorizations and simulations as well.

**Best Practices:** configure when implementing new authorization sets or modifying existing ones to ensure compliance and avoid potential segregation of duties conflicts. Avoid using in static environments where authorization sets and SoD policies are well-established and rarely change.
