# Module Name

**Technical Name:** ModuleName

**Category:** Security

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

The `ModuleName` parameter is used across various custom authorization providers within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It serves as a key component in managing and customizing user authorizations based on roles, job functions, profiles, and application-specific criteria, including last logon dates.

**Business Impact:**

Implementing custom authorizations through this parameter can significantly enhance security by ensuring that access permissions are accurately aligned with users' current roles and responsibilities. It mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and reduces the potential for compliance violations by dynamically adjusting permissions in response to changes in users' roles or job functions.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, `ModuleName` supports the enforcement of finely-tuned access controls tailored to the specific requirements of the organization. This dynamic approach to authorization can improve operational efficiency by automating the process of granting or revoking access based on real-time data, reducing the administrative overhead associated with manual access reviews.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Role-Based Access Control:** Automatically updating user permissions when a user's role within an organization changes, ensuring that they have access to the appropriate resources necessary for their new position.
- **Compliance Management:** Ensuring that access rights comply with regulatory requirements by dynamically adjusting permissions based on changes in compliance policies or user roles.
- **Security Posture Improvement:** Reducing the attack surface by limiting access to sensitive information and applications based on the principle of least privilege and current job functions.

**Related Settings:**

- `AuthoirizationCertificationObjectsForUser`
- `ProfileTailorDataClassesDataContext`
- `User`
- `ReviewElement`

**Best Practices:** Configure when a user's role or job responsibilities change, to ensure access permissions are up-to-date. Avoid when static permissions are sufficient and do not require frequent updates.
