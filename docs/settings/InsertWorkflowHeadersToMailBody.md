# Insert Workflow Headers To Mail Body

**Technical Name:** InsertWorkflowHeadersToMailBody

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter controls whether headers related to workflow actions are included in the mail body that is sent out during various workflow steps. When enabled, key workflow-specific information is dynamically inserted into the email template, providing recipients with the context and details needed to understand and take appropriate action on the workflow task.

**Business Impact:**

Including workflow headers in email communications can significantly enhance the recipients' ability to quickly understand the context and requirements of the workflow task. This can lead to faster response times, improved task management, and overall more efficient workflow execution within the organization. It is particularly beneficial in environments where email is a primary communication tool for workflow tasks.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, emails generated by workflow actions will include additional headers or information at the top of the mail body. This information could include details such as the workflow step name, the action required, and the due date, among others. This makes the emails more informative and actionable, directly impacting the efficiency of task completion.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Context:** A workflow is configured to send an email notification when a task moves to a new step requiring review.
- **Without the Parameter Enabled:** Recipients receive an email with general information about the task, without clear indicators of the workflow step or required action.
- **With the Parameter Enabled:** The email includes specific headers showing it's a review step, indicating what action the recipient needs to take, thus streamlining the process.

- EmailMessageTemplate

**Best Practices:** configure when you want to ensure email recipients have immediate visibility into the workflow steps and required actions directly from their email inbox; avoid when unnecessary to reduce email clutter or if the workflow process is intended to be minimalistic.
