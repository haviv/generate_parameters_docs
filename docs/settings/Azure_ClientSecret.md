# Azure Client Secret

**Technical Name:** Azure_ClientSecret

**Category:** Security

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

The Azure Client Secret is a key component used to authenticate applications in Azure Active Directory (AD). It acts as a password for the application to prove its identity when requesting access to resources in Azure AD.

**Business Impact:**

Securing the Azure Client Secret is critical for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the application and its data. An exposed or poorly managed secret could lead to unauthorized access and potentially compromise sensitive data or systems.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Proper configuration and management of the Azure Client Secret are essential for secure authentication processes. It ensures that only authorized applications can access certain resources within Azure AD, enforcing principles of least privilege and secure access.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Secure Integration:** A business application needs to securely access resources in Azure AD. The Azure Client Secret is configured to authenticate the application ensuring secure API calls to Azure services.
- **Automated Deployment:** During an automated deployment, a CI/CD pipeline uses the Azure Client Secret to authenticate against Azure AD to deploy resources securely.

**Related Settings:**

- Azure_ClientID
- Azure_TenantID
- OAuthLoginProvider

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** Setting up secure authentication for applications accessing Azure AD resources.
- **Avoid when:** The application supports more secure authentication methods that do not require a shared secret.
