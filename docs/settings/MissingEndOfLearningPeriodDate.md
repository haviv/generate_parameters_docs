# Missing End Of Learning Period Date

**Technical Name:** MissingEndOfLearningPeriodDate

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The Missing End Of Learning Period Date parameter is crucial for configuring the end of the learning period for user behavior analytics. This setting helps in defining a cutoff date, after which the system will no longer consider user activities as part of the learning phase. It's integral in transitioning from the learning mode to the enforcement/monitoring phase within the GRC platform.

**Business Impact:**

Not specifying an end date for the learning period could lead to indefinite accumulation of learning data, potentially diluting the effectiveness of anomaly detection and user behavior analysis. By properly configuring this parameter, organizations can ensure that their security and compliance posture is predicated on relevant, timely data, facilitating accurate risk assessment and mitigation strategies.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Upon configuration, the Missing End Of Learning Period Date parameter ensures that the system transitions from a learning state to an active monitoring state. This prevents the system from indefinitely treating all user activities as benign and starts applying learned behaviors for anomaly detection and risk analysis.

**Examples Scenario:**

- An organization deploys a new module within its ERP system and uses the learning period to adapt to the normal usage patterns of its users. Setting the Missing End Of Learning Period Date ensures that after this period, any deviation from the norm is flagged for review or automatic remediation.

**Related Settings:**

- **EnableUserMultipleUsageRecognize**: When enabled, this setting allows the system to recognize and react to instances where a user's behavior deviates significantly from established patterns, which could indicate misuse or an external threat.

**Best Practices:** configure when initializing user behavior learning for new modules or systems, avoid when continuous learning across all periods is preferred for evolving threat detection without a fixed cutoff date.
