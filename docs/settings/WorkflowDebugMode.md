# Workflow Debug Mode

**Technical Name:** WorkflowDebugMode

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** 

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

Enables detailed logging and reporting for actions performed within workflow processes. This mode is particularly useful for diagnosing issues or understanding the behavior of complex workflows.

**Business Impact:**

Activating the Workflow Debug Mode can significantly aid in identifying misconfigurations or errors in workflow actions, leading to more efficient resolutions. However, it may also result in performance overhead due to the extensive logging activity.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When enabled, the system generates detailed logs for every action within a workflow. This includes the start and end of the workflow, decisions made within the workflow, and any errors encountered. This detailed information is useful for troubleshooting but might increase storage requirements for logs.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Issue Diagnosis:** If a workflow is not triggering as expected or an error occurs during execution, enabling Workflow Debug Mode can provide insights into what part of the workflow is failing and why.
- **Audit and Compliance:** When investigating compliance with internal policies or external regulations, detailed logs from Workflow Debug Mode can offer the necessary audit trail of decisions and actions taken within specific workflows.

**Related Settings:** 

- DisablePreviewOfWorkflowForm: Determines whether previewing the workflow form is disabled, potentially related as previews might also be affected by debug settings.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** Diagnosing issues with workflows or during the development and testing phase to ensure workflows are operating as designed.
- **Avoid when:** In production environments, if performance impact is a concern or if logging detailed workflow actions is not necessary for everyday operations.
