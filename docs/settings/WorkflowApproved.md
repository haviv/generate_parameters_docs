**Technical Name:** WorkflowApproved

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** Not specified

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter is used to indicate whether a specific workflow or workflow step has been approved. It is a key component in managing and tracking the approval processes within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform.

**Business Impact:**

The WorkflowApproved parameter has significant implications for governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) processes. Ensuring that workflows are approved in a timely and controlled manner helps organizations maintain compliance with internal policies and external regulations. It directly impacts the efficiency of business operations, audit readiness, and the overall security posture of the organization.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Configuring the WorkflowApproved parameter effectively can streamline the workflow approval process, reduce manual errors, and ensure that all actions within a workflow are properly authorized before proceeding. It enhances the visibility and traceability of actions taken within the GRC platform, facilitating easier auditing and reporting.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Auditing and Compliance:** In an audit workflow, where documents or actions need to be reviewed and approved by specific roles, configuring the WorkflowApproved parameter ensures that the process conforms to the stipulated compliance requirements. This safeguards against unauthorized changes and streamlines audit trails.
  
- **User Access Review:** Within a user access review workflow, setting the WorkflowApproved parameter to indicate approval of user access changes helps in maintaining a secure and compliant access management process. It ensures that only authorized personnel can make or approve changes, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** Implementing any workflow that requires formal approval to move forward. This includes, but is not limited to, change management workflows, user access reviews, and compliance checks.
  
- **Avoid when:** The process is informational only and does not require explicit approval to proceed. This can help in reducing unnecessary bottlenecks in processes where decision-making is streamlined or automated.
