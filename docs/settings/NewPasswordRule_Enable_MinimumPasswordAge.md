# Enable Minimum Password Age

**Technical Name:** NewPasswordRule_Enable_MinimumPasswordAge

**Category:** Security

**Default Value:** Not specified

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

The 'Enable Minimum Password Age' setting prevents the immediate change of user passwords. This control ensures that passwords are not changed too frequently, which can help in avoiding potential security risks associated with rapid password changes. It is part of the suite of password management rules to enhance security protocols.

**Business Impact:**

Enforcing a minimum password age is crucial for organizational security posture. It mitigates the risk of password guessing and brute force attacks by limiting how often users can change passwords. This setting also helps in implementing an effective password history policy, preventing the reuse of recent passwords and thus bolstering the company's defenses against unauthorized access.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When this policy is configured, users cannot change their passwords until the minimum age set by the policy has passed. This delay ensures that password change policies are not circumvented through rapid, consecutive changes. It also aids in the auditability of password changes, making it easier to track and investigate suspicious activities.

**Example Scenario:**

A company has set the 'Enable Minimum Password Age' to 5 days. This means once a user changes their password, they are not allowed to change it again for another 5 days. This policy helps prevent an attacker from gaining access to an account and immediately changing the password to lock out the legitimate user. 

**Related Settings:**

**Best Practices:** 

- Configure when you have clear password policies in place that require users to maintain a password for a certain period before a change is allowed. This can be particularly effective in environments where sensitive data is accessed and security needs to be tightly managed.
  
- Avoid when it may cause unnecessary delay or inconvenience in scenarios where passwords may need to be changed immediately due to a suspected compromise or as part of an incident response process.
