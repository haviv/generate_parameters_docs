**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter is specifically designed for managing user profiles within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It is used to define and implement the technical naming conventions for employee phone numbers within the system's user management workflows. This setting plays a critical role in standardizing the format and validation of phone number entries across different modules within the platform.

**Business Impact:**

A properly configured TechnicalNameForEmployeePhoneNumber can significantly streamline communication processes, ensure consistency across contact information databases, and enhance the reliability of emergency contact protocols. It directly affects the efficiency of operations relying on accurate user contact information, such as system notifications, approval workflows, and identity verification processes.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Once configured, the TechnicalNameForEmployeePhoneNumber ensures that all new user profiles created through the specified workflow actions inherit a standardized phone number format. This uniformity aids in reducing data entry errors, simplifies user identity management, and facilitates easier integration with external communication tools and platforms.

**Examples Scenario:**

- During a system-triggered emergency notification dispatch, having a standardized phone number format ensures that alerts are delivered without errors to all intended recipients, thereby upholding the integrity of the organizationâ€™s crisis communication strategy.
- In a user creation workflow, ensuring that employee phone numbers adhere to a predefined technical name format helps maintain data consistency, which is essential for automated onboarding processes and integrating new users into communication directories.
