**Current Image Logo Width**

**Technical Name:** CurrentImageLogoWidth

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** ""

**Impact Level:** Low

**Description:**

The `CurrentImageLogoWidth` parameter is used to specify the width of the current image logo within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform's user interface. This setting allows for customization of how logos are displayed in terms of size, ensuring that the branding fits well within the designated space on the application's pages.

**Business Impact:**

Adjusting the `CurrentImageLogoWidth` can directly influence the visual representation of an organization's brand on the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. Ensuring the logo is appropriately sized contributes to a professional appearance, enhancing user experience and potentially impacting the perception of the platform's users towards the organization's attention to detail and brand standards.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When the `CurrentImageLogoWidth` is configured, it dictates the pixel width of the logo image displayed across the platform. A value that is too large or too small can negatively affect how the logo appears, potentially leading to a stretched or compressed image that does not accurately represent the organization's branding.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Upgrading Branding:** An organization has recently undergone a rebranding initiative, including updating its logo. The `CurrentImageLogoWidth` parameter is adjusted to accommodate the new logo's dimensions, ensuring it looks crisp and clear on the platform.

**Best Practices:** 

- **configure when:** You have a specific branding guideline that dictates the logo's dimensions for digital platforms, ensuring consistency across all user interface elements.
- **avoid when:** The logo is of a very high resolution that could lead to excessive page load times or if the specified width distorts the logo, impacting its recognition or readability.
