# Archiving Backup Table Pattern

**Technical Name:** ArchivingBackupTablePattern

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

The Archiving Backup Table Pattern parameter is used to specify the naming convention for backup tables created during the data archiving process. This ensures that archived data is stored in an organized manner, facilitating easy retrieval and management of archived content.

**Business Impact:**

Proper configuration of this parameter is crucial for maintaining data integrity and availability. It enables organizations to efficiently manage their archived data, supporting compliance with data retention policies and regulations. Misconfiguration could lead to difficulty in locating and restoring specific archived data when needed, potentially impacting legal compliance and operational efficiency.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When properly configured, this parameter ensures that backup tables are named following a predefined pattern, which aids in the systematic storage and retrieval of archived data. It helps in minimizing the risk of data loss or mismanagement during the archive process.

**Example Scenario:**

An organization needs to archive transaction records which are older than five years to comply with regulatory requirements. By setting the Archiving Backup Table Pattern parameter to `TransArchive_{YYYY}`, archived tables will be created with names like `TransArchive_2018`, making it straightforward to identify and access transaction records from the year 2018.

- **Avoid when**: If there is no clear data retention policy or the naming pattern could conflict with existing database schemas.
