# End Time Default Value

**Technical Name:** EndTimeDefaultValue

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:** None Specified

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The End Time Default Value parameter is used to set a default end time for reporting filters within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It is specifically relevant to the configuration of report generation, influencing how data is filtered and presented based on the report's end time criteria. 

**Business Impact:**

Configuring this parameter can significantly impact how enterprise-level reports are generated, ensuring that reports reflect the most relevant and up-to-date information up to the specified end time. This is crucial for accurate compliance, risk assessments, and audit reporting, as it ensures data completeness and timeliness.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, the End Time Default Value parameter ensures reports automatically consider data up to the configured default end time, reducing manual effort in setting this criterion for each report and enhancing report accuracy and reliability.

**Example Scenario:**

A compliance officer needs to generate a compliance report that reflects the organization's status up to the end of the previous month. By configuring the End Time Default Value parameter to the last date and time of the previous month, they ensure that each report automatically includes data up until that point without manual intervention.

**Best Practices:** Configure when you need consistent end time criteria across multiple reports to ensure data consistency and reporting efficiency. Avoid when reports require varying end times based on specific analysis needs.
