# Sap Application Server Postfix

**Technical Name:** SapApplicationServerPostfix

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The SapApplicationServerPostfix parameter is used to customize and append a specific postfix to the SAP application server's name. This enables easier identification, management, and tracking of server instances within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform.

**Business Impact:**

Configuring this parameter effectively allows businesses to streamline their governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) processes by ensuring that the SAP application servers are easily identifiable. This identification aids in audit and compliance activities by providing clear and concise mapping of actions and responsibilities to specific servers.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- Enhances the clarity in server identification within the system logs by appending a unique or descriptive postfix.
- Facilitates better security and compliance management by enabling precise monitoring and analysis of specific SAP application servers.
- Improves the efficiency of troubleshooting and support processes by quickly directing efforts towards the correctly identified server instances.

**Example Scenario:**

- **Scenario:** A company utilizes multiple SAP application servers across different departments such as HR, Finance, and IT. To ensure efficient monitoring and management, the company decides to append a descriptive postfix to each server name related to its department.
  
  - **Configuration:** For the HR department's SAP application server, they append "_HR" as the postfix, resulting in server names like "SAPServer1_HR".
  - **Benefit:** This naming convention makes it easier for the GRC team to filter logs and manage security policies specific to the HR department, enhancing the overall security management process.

**Related Settings:**

- `SodResolverConfig_UseCompositeRoles` - This setting might influence how roles and permissions are resolved and enforced in conjunction with specific servers.
- SAP HR CustomOrgAssigmentField
- SAP HR CustomOrgAssigmentTable

**Best Practices:** Configure when you have multiple SAP application servers that serve different purposes or departments to improve log readability and security monitoring. Avoid using nondescriptive or generic postfixes that do not add informational value to the server identification process.
