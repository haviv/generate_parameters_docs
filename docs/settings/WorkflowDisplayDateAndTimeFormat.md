**Technical Name:** WorkflowDisplayDateAndTimeFormat

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** 

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The WorkflowDisplayDateAndTimeFormat parameter is responsible for defining the format in which dates and times are presented within workflows in the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This setting ensures that all date and time information across workflows is displayed consistently according to the specified format, catering to the formatting needs and preferences of different organizations.

**Business Impact:**

Proper configuration of this parameter can significantly enhance the readability and understanding of workflow timelines and deadlines, aiding in more efficient decision-making and compliance tracking. It ensures that date and time information is displayed in a manner that aligns with organizational standards or regional preferences, ultimately supporting accurate tracking and management of security, risk, and compliance activities.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Configuring this parameter affects the display format of date and time values within the user interface, particularly in workflow-related features. It governs how users view and interpret timing around workflow actions, deadlines, and historical data, making it crucial for accurate scheduling and reporting functions.

**Examples Scenario:**

- If an organization prefers to use the MM/DD/YYYY format for dates and 12-hour clock format for time, setting this parameter accordingly would ensure that all workflow-related dates and times are displayed in this format, thus eliminating confusion for users accustomed to this format.
  
- For a global company with operations in Europe, setting the date format to DD/MM/YYYY could align better with the local standards, making the interpretation of dates in workflows intuitive for local users.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** Standardizing the display of date and time across all workflows is critical. This is particularly important when your organization operates in multiple regions with different date and time format preferences.
  
- **Avoid when:** If the organization does not have a specific need for a uniform date and time display format across workflows, or if such configuration could lead to confusion due to varying regional standards among the user base.
