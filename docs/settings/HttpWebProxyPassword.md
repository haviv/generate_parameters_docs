# Http Web Proxy Password

**Technical Name:** HttpWebProxyPassword

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The Http Web Proxy Password parameter is used to specify the password required for authentication with a web proxy server that stands between the client and the internet. This setting is part of the configuration that allows Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to securely connect to external services through a proxy.

**Business Impact:**

Configuring the Http Web Proxy Password ensures that automated processes and data flows within the Pathlock Cloud GRC environment can securely and seamlessly communicate with external APIs and services through the proxy. This is critical for maintaining data security and ensuring compliance with external data sources.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When the Http Web Proxy Password is configured, it enables the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to authenticate against a specified HTTP proxy server using the provided credentials. This authentication is essential for data transfer and API communication between the Pathlock environment and external services when going through a secured web proxy.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Scenario:** An organization requires all outbound internet traffic to go through a secured web proxy to meet their internal security policies and compliance requirements. The Http Web Proxy Password is configured within Pathlock Cloud GRC to ensure that all outbound connections from the platform are authenticated and encrypted, allowing secure data exchange with third-party services.

**Related Settings:**

- HttpWebProxyUser

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** there is a need to securely connect to external services through a web proxy which requires authentication. It ensures that data exchanged between Pathlock Cloud GRC and external services is secure and compliant with organizational policies.
  
- **Avoid when:** there is no proxy between Pathlock Cloud GRC and the internet or if the proxy does not require authentication. In such cases, configuring this parameter might lead to unnecessary complexity in the communication setup.
