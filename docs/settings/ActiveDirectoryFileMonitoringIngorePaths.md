**Active Directory File Monitoring Ignore Paths**

**Technical Name:** ActiveDirectoryFileMonitoringIngorePaths

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `ActiveDirectoryFileMonitoringIgnorePaths` parameter specifies directories within the Active Directory environment that should be excluded from file monitoring processes. This setting is crucial for optimizing performance by eliminating unnecessary monitoring of directories that don't contain sensitive or relevant information.

**Business Impact:**

Ignoring specific paths during file monitoring reduces the system's load, allowing Pathlock Cloud GRC to focus on directories that contain critical security, risk, or compliance data. This ensures that system resources are allocated efficiently, enhancing operational performance and minimizing the risk associated with monitoring irrelevant directories.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- Reduces the number of directories monitored, thereby decreasing the system's workload.
- Helps in concentrating monitoring efforts on areas with potential compliance and security implications.
- Avoids generating unnecessary alerts from directories that are not of interest, leading to clearer and more actionable insights.

**Examples Scenario:**

A company uses the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to secure and monitor their Active Directory environment. They want to avoid monitoring directories that contain employee personal documents and only focus on directories that contain sensitive information such as financial reports and HR records. By configuring `ActiveDirectoryFileMonitoringIgnorePaths` to ignore the paths to employee document directories, they ensure the platform concentrates on monitoring critical directories, thereby optimizing resource use and focusing security measures on high-risk areas.

**Related Settings:**

- ActiveDirectoryAccountDisableOnly

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** there are specific directories that regularly contain non-sensitive information, or their monitoring would not yield beneficial insights related to security, compliance, or risk management.
  
- **Avoid when:** all directories potentially contain sensitive information or if the scope of what needs to be monitored is still being determined. It's critical to ensure that ignoring certain paths doesn't inadvertently compromise security or compliance postures.
