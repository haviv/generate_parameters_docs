**Technical Name:** ExcelFileProvider_FileWithHeader

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** Not Applicable

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** This parameter configures the Excel file data import provider to recognize and process the first row of the provided spreadsheet as a header row. This ensures that column names are correctly identified and matched with the respective data fields in the system.

**Business Impact:** Proper configuration of this parameter optimizes data import processes by ensuring accurate mapping of employee data fields to the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform's data structure. This facilitates seamless integration of organizational structure data, thereby enhancing the efficiency of security, risk, and compliance management activities.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- **Correct Data Mapping:** The system accurately maps spreadsheet columns to corresponding data fields within the Pathlock platform.
- **Enhanced Data Integrity:** By recognizing the header row, the risk of data import errors is significantly reduced, thereby maintaining the integrity of imported data.
- **Data Import Efficiency:** Streamlines the data import process by eliminating the need for manual data field identification, resulting in faster and more efficient data integration.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **HR Employee Data Import:** An organization wishes to import an Excel spreadsheet containing employee records into the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. By enabling the ExcelFileProvider_FileWithHeader parameter, the system recognizes the first row as containing the column headers (e.g., EmployeeID, Name, Department) and correctly maps the data to the platformâ€™s employee management module.

**Related Settings:** Not specified in the provided code references.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** Importing data from Excel spreadsheets where the first row contains column names. This is crucial for ensuring the correct mapping of data to the Pathlock platform.
- **Avoid when:** Importing data from Excel spreadsheets that do not have a header row, or when the first row contains actual data instead of column names. In such cases, adjusting the data format or using a different import method may be necessary to prevent data import errors.
