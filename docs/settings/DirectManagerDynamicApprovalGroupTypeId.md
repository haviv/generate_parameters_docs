# Direct Manager Dynamic Approval Group Type

**Technical Name:** DirectManagerDynamicApprovalGroupTypeId

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

This parameter controls the dynamic selection of approval groups based on the direct manager hierarchy in workflow steps. It is utilized in scenarios where approval requests need to be dynamically rerouted or approved based on an organization's direct management structure.

**Business Impact:**

Implementing the Direct Manager Dynamic Approval Group Type ensures that approval processes are automatically adjusted according to the direct management chain, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of workflow approvals. This functionality supports compliance with internal controls and streamlines management oversight in approval processes.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, this parameter dynamically influences the workflow approval process by selecting the appropriate approval group based on the requester's direct manager, potentially rerouting requests to alternative approval groups if standard conditions are not met.

**Examples Scenario:**

1. An employee requests access to sensitive data. The workflow, configured with the Direct Manager Dynamic Approval Group Type, automatically routes the request to the employee's direct manager for approval.
2. If the direct manager is unavailable, the system may reroute the request to an alternative approval group designated for such scenarios, preventing delays in the approval process.

**Best Practices:** configure when the approval process requires adherence to direct managerial hierarchy, avoid when workflows do not depend on managerial structure for approvals.
