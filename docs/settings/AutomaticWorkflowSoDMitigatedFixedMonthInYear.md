**Technical Name:** AutomaticWorkflowSoDMitigatedFixedMonthInYear

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** 

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** This parameter specifies the fixed month of the year when automatic workflows for Segregation of Duties (SoD) mitigation are initiated. It is utilized in scheduling and automating the review and mitigation processes for access control conflicts within the system.

**Business Impact:** Proper configuration of this parameter ensures timely and consistent review of SoD conflicts. It aids in aligning the mitigation process with organizational audit cycles or compliance reporting periods, thus reducing the risk of non-compliance and enhancing the overall security posture.

**Technical Impact when configured:** Schedules the automatic initiation of workflow steps for SoD conflict mitigation, ensuring that mitigations are processed in a timely manner and are aligned with compliance or audit requirements.

**Examples Scenario:** If an organization's fiscal year end audit requires all SoD conflicts to be reviewed and resolved by April, setting this parameter to ’4’ ensures that all workflows related to SoD conflict mitigation are automatically triggered in April, in preparation for the audit.

**Best Practices:** Configure this parameter in alignment with your organization's audit schedule or the peak times for compliance reporting to ensure all SoD conflicts are addressed beforehand. Avoid setting this parameter without considering your organization’s specific compliance and audit schedule to prevent off-cycle workflow triggers.
