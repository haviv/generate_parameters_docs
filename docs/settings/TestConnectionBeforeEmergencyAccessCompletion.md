# Test Connection Before Emergency Access Completion

**Technical Name:** TestConnectionBeforeEmergencyAccessCompletion

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** N/A

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** This parameter ensures that a connection test is performed before granting emergency access. It acts as a precautionary check within workflow processes, ensuring the system's integrity and connectivity before finalizing emergency access permissions.

**Business Impact:** Facilitates secure and reliable emergency access by preemptively identifying and mitigating connectivity issues, thus ensuring uninterrupted operations and safeguarding against potential security risks during critical moments.

**Technical Impact when configured:** Enforces a system check to verify connectivity prior to the completion of emergency access workflows. This helps in avoiding the granting of access rights in situations where system communication might be compromised, thereby enhancing security and operational certainty.

**Examples Scenario:** In a scenario where an immediate access is required due to an urgent incident, this parameter ensures that the system is fully operational and can communicate with necessary services before access is granted, preventing potential delays or security breaches in crisis situations.

**Related Settings:** N/A

**Best Practices:** 
- **Configure when:** Immediate or emergency access to systems is a recurrent necessity, especially in environments where ensuring the stability and reliability of connections prior to access grant is critical.
- **Avoid when:** The environment has redundant, fail-safe connectivity measures in place, or the delay caused by testing connections significantly hampers emergency response times.
