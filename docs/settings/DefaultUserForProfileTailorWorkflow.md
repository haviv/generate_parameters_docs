# Default User For Pathlock Workflow

**Technical Name:** DefaultUserForProfileTailorWorkflow

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** Not specified

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter determines the default user account that the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform uses in workflows where a specific user cannot be determined or is not specified. It ensures that processes within the ProfileTailor suite, particularly related to event delivery and workflow management, have a fallback user account for consistent operation.

**Business Impact:**

Correct configuration of the DefaultUserForProfileTailorWorkflow parameter ensures uninterrupted workflow operations, particularly when automated tasks require a user context. By providing a default user, organizations can maintain fluidity in their compliance and security processes, avoiding potential delays or failures in event handling and report generation.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When properly configured, this parameter allows for fallback operations within the platform's automation and workflow processes, ensuring tasks such as report generation and event delivery can proceed even when specific user details are not available or applicable.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Report Generation:** When generating detailed reports within the ProfileTailor suite, if the system cannot associate the task with a specific user, the default user specified by this parameter will be used, ensuring that the report generation process completes successfully.

**Related Settings:**

- `WorkflowAttachmentsFiles`: Specifies the location for storing workflow attachment files, which may be used in conjunction with the default user for processing and storing generated reports or workflow-related documents.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** it is crucial to ensure workflow continuity in automated processes, especially in environments with complex user management scenarios or where user-specific data may not always be available.
  
- **Avoid when:** every workflow or automated process can reliably determine and use a specific user context without the need for a fallback user account.
