# Send Step Already Been Approved By Someone Else Mail

**Technical Name:** SendStepAlreadyBeenApprovedBySomeoneElseMail

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The parameter `SendStepAlreadyBeenApprovedBySomeoneElseMail` is designed to trigger an email notification when an action within a workflow step has already been approved by another user. This setting ensures that relevant parties are promptly informed about the progress and decisions made during the workflow process, thereby maintaining transparency and efficiency in task execution.

**Business Impact:**

Activating this parameter can significantly impact operational efficiency by preventing redundant approvals and actions. It keeps stakeholders informed about the workflow progress, ensuring that tasks are not needlessly revisited, which can save time and reduce confusion in process management.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When this parameter is configured, the system automatically sends out an email notification if a step in a workflow receives approval from another user before the current user's action. This functionality helps in maintaining process integrity by informing users of important updates, which is crucial for workflows that involve sequential approvals or tasks that should not be duplicated.

**Examples Scenario:**

- In a procurement process, if a purchase order has already been approved by a finance manager, another approver attempting to approve the same order will receive a notification indicating that the step has already been completed. This prevents duplication of efforts and keeps all parties updated on the workflow status.

**Related Settings:**

- `SMSUrl`: This setting might be used in conjunction with the email notification to send SMS alerts for critical workflow milestones or updates.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure When:** It's beneficial to activate this parameter in processes where tasks are highly dependent on sequential approvals or in scenarios where multiple stakeholders are involved in a singular decision-making process.
  
- **Avoid When:** If the workflow process is straightforward or involves tasks that can safely overlap without causing operational inefficiencies, it might be unnecessary to configure this notification.
