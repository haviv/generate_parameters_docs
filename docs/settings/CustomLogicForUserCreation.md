# Custom Logic For User Creation

**Technical Name:** CustomLogicForUserCreation

**Category:** User Management

**Default Value:** None

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

The `CustomLogicForUserCreation` parameter is designed to facilitate selective user creation based on predefined logic, specifically targeting integration with various system types like Active Directory connectors and Exchange. It allows for custom logic to be applied during the user creation process, enhancing the flexibility and control over how and when users are created within the system. 

**Business Impact:**

Implementing custom logic for user creation enables organizations to streamline their onboarding process, ensure compliance with internal policies, and maintain high levels of security. By tailoring user creation to specific requirements and conditions, companies can significantly reduce manual overhead, mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, and ensure consistency across their digital environment.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, this parameter actively checks the system types involved in the user creation process, such as Active Directory or Exchange, and applies custom logic to create user profiles accordingly. This can include setting conditions for user creation, modifying user attribute mappings, or integrating additional steps such as approvals or notifications based on the system type.

**Examples Scenario:**

- In an organization using Active Directory for user management, the `CustomLogicForUserCreation` can be configured to automatically assign specific roles and permissions based on department codes, thereby speeding up the user provisioning process.
  
- For a company that utilizes Exchange for email services, this parameter can ensure that email accounts are only created for users with specific roles or in certain departments, enhancing security and resource allocation efficiency.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** There is a need to automate the user creation process while adhering to specific organizational policies or system requirements. Implementing custom logic can help in scenarios where user roles, permissions, or attributes need to be dynamically assigned based on certain conditions.

- **Avoid when:** User creation processes are straightforward or when there is no clear requirement for dynamic customization based on system types or user attributes. Overcomplicating the user creation process with unnecessary custom logic can lead to maintenance challenges and increase the risk of errors.
