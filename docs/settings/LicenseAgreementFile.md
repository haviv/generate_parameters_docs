**Technical Name:** LicenseAgreementFile

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

The License Agreement File parameter refers to the file path or identifier for the licensing agreement documentation that is used within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This parameter ensures that the platform's users are aware of and comply with the licensing terms and conditions set forth by the organization.

**Business Impact:**

Having a correctly configured License Agreement File is crucial for maintaining legal compliance and ensuring that all users understand their rights and obligations with respect to the software's use. It aids in preventing unauthorized use of the software and mitigates legal risks associated with copyright infringement.

**Technical Impact when configured:** 

Configuring the License Agreement File appropriately ensures that all users must acknowledge or agree to the licensing terms before getting access to the platform. This might involve displaying the agreement upon initial login or as part of the user onboarding process.

**Examples Scenario:**

During onboarding, a new user is prompted to review and accept the license agreement stored in the License Agreement File before being granted access to the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. The agreement outlines permissible uses of the software, any limitations on redistribution, and the user's rights under the license.

**Best Practices:** configure when setting up the system for the first time or whenever the licensing agreement changes, avoid when unauthorized changes could lead to legal noncompliance.
