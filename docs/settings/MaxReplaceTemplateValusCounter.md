# Max Replace Template Values Counter

**Technical Name:** MaxReplaceTemplateValusCounter

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** *Not Specified in the Provided References*

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter controls the maximum number of template values that can be replaced. It ensures that the system can handle a set number of replacements effectively, preventing excessive computational load or potential misuse through template override attacks.

**Business Impact:**

By limiting the number of template values that can be replaced, this setting helps in maintaining the integrity and performance of the mail template system within Pathlock GRC. It prevents potential exploitation that could lead to system performance degradation or unauthorized data access.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Adjusting this parameter affects the system's ability to dynamically replace values in mail templates. A lower value may restrict flexibility in mail customization, while a very high value could risk performance issues or enable unintended overrides.

**Examples Scenario:**

If the system sends out notifications with customized content pulled from a database, the `MaxReplaceTemplateValusCounter` ensures that only a safe number of placeholders in the email template are replaced, safeguarding against attempts to exploit the system by injecting an excessive number of overrides.

**Best Practices:** configure when you need to ensure system stability in scenarios with extensive use of dynamic content in emails, avoid when there's a need for vast numbers of placeholders due to the complexity of the email templates being used.
