**Description:** This parameter determines whether the creation date of a user is displayed within the User Card in the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform.

**Business Impact:** Displaying the creation date in the User Card helps in auditing and tracking the lifecycle of user accounts within the organization. It enables administrators to quickly assess the age of an account, assisting in user management and compliance processes.

**Technical Impact: when configured** Enabling this feature will result in the user's creation date being visible on the User Card interface, which could aid in various administrative and audit tasks by providing essential user account information at a glance.

**Examples Scenario:** If an administrator wants to review user accounts for cleanup, showing the creation date can help identify old or possibly unused accounts based on their age. For instance, if a user's creation date is several years old and there has been no recent activity, it might prompt a review of that account's necessity.
