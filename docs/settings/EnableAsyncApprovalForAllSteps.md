# Enable Async Approval For All Steps

**Technical Name:** EnableAsyncApprovalForAllSteps

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** 0

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `EnableAsyncApprovalForAllSteps` parameter controls whether approvals within workflow steps are processed asynchronously. When enabled, this setting allows for each step in a workflow to be approved without waiting for the previous steps to be completed, streamlining the workflow process.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling this feature can significantly reduce the time required to process workflows by allowing subsequent steps to proceed without the need for prior steps to be completed. This can be particularly beneficial for complex workflows with multiple approval stages, as it helps in speeding up decision-making processes and improving overall efficiency.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Activating asynchronous approval can lead to faster workflow execution as approvals are processed in parallel. However, it necessitates robust error handling and clear communication channels to manage the dependencies between workflow steps effectively.

**Example Scenario:**

Suppose a workflow consists of three steps: Initial Review, Department Approval, and Final Sign-off. Enabling the `EnableAsyncApprovalForAllSteps` parameter would allow the Department Approval and Final Sign-off steps to proceed in parallel with the Initial Review, assuming no inter-step dependencies that mandate sequential completion.

**Best Practices:** configure when workflows are well-defined and do not require sequential processing. Avoid when steps are highly dependent on the outcomes of previous steps to ensure accuracy and integrity of the process.
