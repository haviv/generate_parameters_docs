# Max Attempts To Assign Position

**Technical Name:** MaxAttemptsToAssignPosition

**Category:** User Management

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter controls the maximum number of attempts the system will make to assign a position to a user. It specifically applies in scenarios where a position is assigned but not validated, prompting an update or reassignment attempt.

**Business Impact:**

Ensuring the correct number of attempts for assigning positions to users is crucial for maintaining the integrity of role assignments within an organization. Too many unsuccessful attempts can indicate underlying issues with role definitions or user eligibility, potentially leading to compliance risks or operational inefficiencies.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Proper configuration helps in efficiently managing the system's persistence in attempting to assign positions, thereby balancing the need for rigorous assignment protocols with the practicalities of system performance and user experience. It assists in avoiding infinite loops or excessive resource consumption in the case of assignment issues.

**Examples Scenario:**

Consider a scenario where a user's assigned position becomes invalid due to changes in role definitions or organizational structure. The system will attempt to reassign the position up to the maximum configured attempts, ensuring that users are not left without necessary role assignments for extended periods.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** You have a clear understanding of the average number of attempts usually required for successful position assignments in your organizational context. This helps in setting a value that optimizes between resilience and system efficiency.
  
- **Avoid when:** There is no clear pattern or predictability to the success of position assignments within your organization. In such cases, a review of the role assignment process may be more beneficial than configuring this parameter.
