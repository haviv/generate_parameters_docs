# Ole Db Driver For Text File

**Technical Name:** OleDbDriverForTextFile

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The OleDbDriverForTextFile parameter is used within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to determine the type of driver used for connecting to and reading data from text files, including CSV and TXT file formats. This setting is important for scenarios where data import or integration tasks are handled through text files.

**Business Impact:**

Adjusting this parameter impacts how the platform interacts with external data sources in text format. It can affect both the performance of data import tasks and the accuracy of data being imported into the Pathlock Cloud GRC system. Incorrect configuration may result in failed data imports or incorrect data processing, which could lead to inaccurate risk assessments and compliance reports.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Proper configuration facilitates the seamless import and processing of data from CSV and TXT files, allowing for efficient data integration from varied sources. Misconfiguration could lead to connectivity issues, incorrect data parsing, and ultimately, data integrity issues within the platform.

**Examples Scenario:**

A company needs to periodically import a large CSV file containing employee roles and access rights into the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to perform SoD (Segregation of Duties) analysis and compliance checks. By correctly setting the OleDbDriverForTextFile parameter, the platform can accurately parse and import the CSV data, ensuring that the compliance and risk analysis is based on up-to-date and correct information.

**Best Practices:** 

- **configure when:** the platform needs to connect to and import data from text files such as CSV and TXT for compliance, risk analysis, or integration purposes.
- **avoid when:** the platform does not require data import from text files or if an alternative data integration method is more suitable for the use case.
