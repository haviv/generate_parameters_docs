# Filter Control Width Long

**Technical Name:** FilterControlWidthLong

**Category:** General - UI

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:**

**Description:**

The Filter Control Width Long parameter is used to define the width of filter controls within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It allows for customization of the user interface to better accommodate complex filters that require more space for display.

**Business Impact:**

Adjusting the width of the filter controls can significantly improve the user experience by making complex filters more readable and easier to use. This can lead to more efficient data analysis and decision-making processes, as users are better able to specify and apply filters that match their requirements.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Configuring the Filter Control Width Long parameter can affect the layout and usability of the UI where filters are employed. A wider filter control can accommodate more detailed filters without truncation, enhancing clarification and readability for end-users.

**Examples Scenario:**

In a scenario where a compliance officer needs to apply multiple conditions to a filter for generating a compliance report, the default filter control width might not be sufficient to clearly display all conditions. By configuring the Filter Control Width Long to a greater value, the filter control will expand, allowing for all conditions to be visible and easily modifiable, thus making the reporting process more efficient and less prone to errors.

**Best Practices:** 

configure when complex filters commonly used require more space for clear visibility; avoid when the current UI layout does not have the space to accommodate wider filters without affecting other UI elements negatively.
