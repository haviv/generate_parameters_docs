**Impact Level:** Low

**Description:**

The Gender Field parameter is used to specify the gender information for users within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This parameter aids in personalizing user data and ensuring that communication and data processing are aligned with individual identities.

**Business Impact:**

Incorporating gender information into user management processes can enhance the inclusivity and personalization of the GRC platform. It ensures that reporting and user interface elements can be adapted to respectfully address users, contributing to a positive user experience and supporting diversity and inclusion initiatives.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When the Gender Field is configured, the system can utilize gender-specific data for more nuanced reporting, auditing, and user interface personalization. This might affect how users receive notifications, how profiles are displayed, and how data is reported in compliance with gender considerations.

**Examples Scenario:**

A company employs the Gender Field to tailor communication and reporting within the GRC platform. By recognizing the individuals' preferred gender identity, communications from the platform use appropriate pronouns, enhancing the respectful and personalized approach towards every user.
