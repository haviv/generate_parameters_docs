# Enable Apply Changes From Authorization Simulation in Role to User

**Technical Name:** EnableApplyChangesFromAuthorizationSimulationRoleToUser

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** 

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** 

This parameter enables the application of changes identified during an authorization simulation from roles to users in the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It is designed to facilitate the automatic update of user authorizations based on simulation outcomes.

**Business Impact:** 

Enabling this parameter can streamline user access management and ensure that access rights are promptly updated to reflect changes in roles. It significantly impacts compliance and security by ensuring that only authorized users have access to specific information and systems. This capability is particularly critical for organizations looking to maintain strict adherence to security policies and regulatory requirements.

**Technical Impact when configured:** 

When enabled, this configuration allows automatic updates to user permissions based on the simulated changes in role permissions. This ensures that modifications to role definitions are accurately and efficiently propagated to users, thus maintaining the integrity of access controls and reducing the administrative burden on security teams.

**Examples Scenario:** 

- An organization performs a role simulation to see the impact of granting additional permissions to a certain role. Upon review, the organization decides to implement these changes. With this parameter enabled, the system automatically updates the permissions for all users associated with that role, ensuring immediate compliance and security posture improvement.

**Related Settings:** 

- EmployeeNumberLength
- EmployeeNumberPrefix

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** there is a need for dynamic access control, where user permissions need to be automatically adjusted based on changes to role definitions. This is especially useful in rapidly changing environments where manual updates are impractical.
  
- **Avoid when:** the organization is not prepared to manage the potential volume of automatic changes, or where changes in user permissions require thorough review and approval processes not supported by automatic propagation.
