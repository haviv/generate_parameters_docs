# Allowed Upload Content Type

**Technical Name:** AllowedUploadContentType

**Category:** Security

**Default Value:** 

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

The Allowed Upload Content Type parameter defines a whitelist of acceptable file formats that can be uploaded, ensuring only files with specified extensions are accepted by the system. This is part of Pathlock's preventive controls for data validation, aimed at mitigating the risk of malicious file uploads.

**Business Impact:**

Restricting allowed file types for upload can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches. By preventing users from uploading potentially harmful files, organizations can protect their critical systems and data from unauthorized access, malware, and other cybersecurity threats. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive business information.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, the Allowed Upload Content Type parameter actively filters incoming files, rejecting any that do not match the designated content types. This ensures that only files with expected and safe extensions are processed by the system, thus providing a proactive security measure against possible exploits utilizing file uploads.

**Example Scenario:**

- Scenario: An organization wants to ensure that only image files can be uploaded as user avatars to their GRC platform. By setting the Allowed Upload Content Type to image file types (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`), they can effectively block attempts to upload executable files (.exe) or scripts (.js, .php) that could potentially be used to compromise the system.

- SecuritySettings.RestrictFileUploads

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** Setting up secure file upload functionalities. Specify allowed file types that closely align with business requirements and operational contexts to minimize security risks.
- **Avoid when:** There is uncertainty about the types of files users need to upload. In such cases, conduct a thorough analysis to identify acceptable formats before enforcing restrictions.
