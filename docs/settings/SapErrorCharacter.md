# Sap Error Character

**Technical Name:** SapErrorCharacter

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** -1

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The SapErrorCharacter parameter is used to define a specific character or identifier that represents or triggers an error state within various SAP integration points or processes in the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform.

**Business Impact:**

Correct configuration of this parameter ensures accurate error handling and reporting in SAP-related workflows and integrations. Misconfiguration can lead to the overlooking of critical errors, impacting data integrity, security, and compliance processes.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured with an appropriate value, the system will correctly identify and log errors encountered during SAP data processing and integration tasks. This aids in troubleshooting, auditing, and maintaining the overall health of SAP-related processes.

**Examples Scenario:**

Imagine a scenario where a process within the Pathlock platform is responsible for importing user roles from SAP. If an error character is detected during this import (e.g., "-1" signifies a failure to retrieve a specific role), the system can halt the process and alert administrators, thus preventing incorrect role assignments.
