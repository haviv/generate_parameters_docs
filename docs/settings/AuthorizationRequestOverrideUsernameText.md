# Authorization Request Override Username Text

**Technical Name:** AuthorizationRequestOverrideUsernameText

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** (No default value specified, as it likely depends on implementation specifics.)

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The Authorization Request Override Username Text parameter is designed to allow customization of the text displayed for the username field in authorization requests. This parameter enables organizations to tailor the language or terminology used on the request form, ensuring clarity and consistency with internal naming conventions.

**Business Impact:**

Configuring this parameter to match organizational language around user identification can reduce confusion during the request process, streamline user experience, and potentially decrease the number of incorrectly filled requests. It affords businesses greater control over how authorization processes are presented to users, thereby enhancing adherence to internal policies and the overall security posture.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When this parameter is configured, it replaces the default text or label for the username input field on authorization request forms within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This can be particularly useful in multilingual organizations or in scenarios where specific terminology is preferred over generic terms.

**Examples Scenario:**

- In an organization where employees are referred to as "Associates", the default label "User" might be replaced with "Associate ID" to better reflect the organizational terminology, thereby reducing confusion.
- A company might change the label to "Employee Number" if identification within the company is primarily done through unique employee numbers rather than user names.

**Related Settings:**

- Enable User Auto-Complete: Allows enabling or disabling of auto-complete for the user field in the request form.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when** you need to align the authorization request process with internal naming conventions or when seeking to improve the clarity of form fields for non-technical users.
- **Avoid when** the default labeling meets your organization's needs, or when frequent changes could confuse users accustomed to the existing terminology.
