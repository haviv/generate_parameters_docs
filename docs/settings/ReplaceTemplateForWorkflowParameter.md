**Technical Name:** ReplaceTemplateForWorkflowParameter

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** N/A

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The ReplaceTemplateForWorkflowParameter is designed to modify or override existing parameter values in workflow configurations. It supports the customization of workflows by allowing the injection of new values into workflow parameters dynamically.

**Business Impact:**

This parameter permits the tailoring of workflows to specific business requirements without the need to alter the underlying workflow logic. It enhances flexibility, supports business process customization, and reduces the need for multiple similar workflows.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Once configured, this parameter dynamically replaces or supplements the values of existing workflow parameters. This adjustment can lead to changes in how workflows operate, potentially altering the flow of tasks, the assignment of responsibilities, or the criteria for workflow progression.

**Examples Scenario:**

In a scenario where an organization needs to adjust the approval process based on the project's value, the ReplaceTemplateForWorkflowParameter could dynamically adjust the approval thresholds within the workflow parameters depending on the project's budget, without changing the workflow itself.
