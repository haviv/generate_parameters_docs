**Description:**

The GenderMaleValue parameter is used within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to configure gender-related settings, specifically for identifying male business partners or users. This parameter can be used in various contexts where gender information is relevant to security, reporting, or compliance settings.

**Business Impact:**

Setting the GenderMaleValue correctly ensures accurate representation and reporting of male individuals within the system. This can impact how data is filtered, reported, and how compliance checks are performed concerning gender-based regulations or internal policies.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Proper configuration of the GenderMaleValue parameter ensures that male users are correctly identified across the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform functionalities. This identification can affect access controls, reporting mechanisms, and compliance validation processes, ensuring they align with the organization's gender data standards.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Compliance Reporting:** An organization needs to report compliance with gender equality regulations and uses the GenderMaleValue parameter to accurately count and report the number of male employees accessing certain systems.
- **User Management:** In configuring access rights, an administrator sets up profiles based on gender, utilizing the GenderMaleValue to apply specific presets or restrictions for male business partners or users.
- **Security Profiles:** Security policies are tailored based on gender demographics. The GenderMaleValue aids in the creation of male-specific security profiles, enhancing the effectiveness of personalized security measures.

**Related Settings:**

- `BusinessPartnerFemale`: This setting is used alongside GenderMaleValue to configure and recognize the gender of business partners or users as female.

**Best Practices:** 
- **Configure when:** Setting up user profiles, generating compliance reports, or customizing security measures based on gender-specific data.
- **Avoid when:** Gender data is irrelevant to the platform's use case, or if gender-based configurations could lead to data privacy concerns or discrimination.
