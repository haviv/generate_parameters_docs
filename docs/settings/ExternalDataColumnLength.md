**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** ""

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

Configures the length of data columns used for external data sources in the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This setting is crucial for ensuring that external data matches the expected format and length within the system.

**Business Impact:**

Proper configuration of this parameter ensures seamless integration and processing of external data, helping maintain data integrity and accuracy. Misconfiguration can lead to data truncation, import errors, or processing delays, affecting decision-making processes and compliance reporting.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- Ensures that external data columns align with the specified length requirement, facilitating accurate data storage and retrieval.
- Prevents data truncation errors that may occur when the data exceeds the predefined column length.
- Enhances data import efficiency by aligning external data formats with system expectations.

**Examples Scenario:**

A business decides to import employee data from an external HR system. Setting the correct `ExternalDataColumnLength` ensures that the employee ID, which is a critical piece of data, is fully captured without truncation. This guarantees that employee records are correctly matched and updated in the Pathlock GRC platform.

**Related Settings:**

- `EmployeeAlternativeKeyColumn`

**Best Practices:** 

- Configure when setting up new data import routines or when the format of external data sources changes.
- Avoid configuration without consulting database and external data source specifications to prevent mismatches in data column lengths.
