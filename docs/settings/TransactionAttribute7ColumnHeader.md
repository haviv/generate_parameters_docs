**Default Value:** None

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**
This parameter defines the column header name for the transaction attribute 7 in various reports and exports. It is used to customize the display of transaction-related information in the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform, ensuring that data is presented with relevant context specific to an organizationâ€™s needs.

**Business Impact:**
Customizing this parameter helps in tailoring reports to meet compliance requirements, audit needs, and internal risk management processes by clearly defining and distinguishing transaction attributes. This affects how data insights and risks are communicated across the organization, aiding in more informed decision-making.

**Technical Impact when configured:**
When set, this parameter alters the label of the transaction attribute 7 column, affecting all reports and data exports where this attribute is included. It ensures that users can recognize and understand the data presented without needing to translate or guess what each attribute represents, thereby enhancing report readability and usefulness.

**Example Scenario:**
- An organization needs to include custom transaction attributes in their audit reports for better traceability of actions within their financial system. By configuring 'Transaction Attribute7 Column Header' to "Invoice Approval Level", the audit reports will now include a column with this specific header, making it clear what the data represents to auditors and internal review teams.

**Best Practices:** 
- **Configure when**: You need to clarify the nature of the data being exported or reported on, especially when dealing with custom transaction attributes that might not be immediately clear to all stakeholders.
- **Avoid when**: Default labeling meets organizational needs, or if changes might confuse users accustomed to standard terminologies.
