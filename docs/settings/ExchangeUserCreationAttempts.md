# Exchange User Creation Attempts

**Technical Name:** ExchangeUserCreationAttempts

**Category:** User Management

**Default Value:** Not specified

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter controls the number of attempts allowed for creating a new user in the Exchange environment. It is designed to regulate and monitor the user creation process, ensuring it aligns with the organization's security and compliance standards.

**Business Impact:**

Misconfiguring this parameter can lead to unauthorized access or denial of service. Setting it too high might allow for repeated attempts by unauthorized entities to create user accounts, while setting it too low may hinder legitimate administrative tasks.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- **Correct Configuration:** Helps in preventing brute force attacks by limiting the number of creation attempts, thus enhancing the security of the Exchange environment.
- **Incorrect Configuration:** May either lock out legitimate administrative efforts from creating necessary user accounts or allow attackers multiple attempts at creating malicious accounts.

**Examples Scenario:**

- Scenario 1: An organization wants to tighten its security controls around user creation to prevent unauthorized access. By setting the `ExchangeUserCreationAttempts` parameter to a lower threshold, it can prevent repeated, unauthorized attempts to create user accounts.

**Related Settings:** Not specified

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** There is a necessity to limit the number of times an entity may attempt to create a user account, adding an additional layer of security.
- **Avoid when:** The setting may interfere with legitimate administrative tasks or automated processes that require higher thresholds for user creation attempts.
