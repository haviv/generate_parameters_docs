**Technical Name:** SE16NReadChangeDocumentsDetails

**Category:** Audit

**Default Value:** None

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

This parameter controls the extraction and processing of change document details from SAP systems, specifically focusing on non-PTD (Pathlock Tailored Document) classes. It's designed to filter and retrieve change document types based on the system ID and their active status, ensuring only relevant changes are considered for audit and review.

**Business Impact:**

Ensuring accurate and comprehensive monitoring of changes within the SAP environment is critical for maintaining system integrity and compliance. By enabling this parameter, organizations can enhance their oversight of system modifications, reduce risks associated with unauthorized changes, and support compliance with internal policies and external regulations.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When activated, SE16NReadChangeDocumentsDetails parameter initiates the inclusion of specific SAP change document types in audit reviews, excluding custom PTD-defined types. This focused approach allows for a more streamlined audit process, reducing noise from less relevant changes and highlighting potential areas of risk or non-compliance.

**Examples Scenario:**

1. An auditor wants to review all changes made in the SAP system related to financial transactions within the last quarter. By activating SE16NReadChangeDocumentsDetails, they can efficiently extract this specific subset of change documents for review, enhancing the audit's effectiveness and relevance.

**Related Settings:** None

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** Comprehensive audit trails of system changes are necessary, particularly for sensitive areas like financial transactions, user management, or system configuration changes.
- **Avoid when:** The overhead of processing and reviewing a large volume of change documents may outweigh the benefits, or in systems where change monitoring is managed through alternative mechanisms.
