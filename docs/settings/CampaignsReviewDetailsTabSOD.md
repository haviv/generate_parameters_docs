**Technical Name:** CampaignsReviewDetailsTabSOD

**Category:** Compliance

**Default Value:** Not provided

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:** This parameter controls the visibility and behavior of the Separation of Duties (SoD) information within the Campaigns Review Details Tab on the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform.

**Business Impact:** Proper configuration ensures that compliance officers and auditors can effectively review SoD violations and history within authorization certification campaigns, which is crucial for maintaining internal controls and compliance with regulatory requirements.

**Technical Impact when configured:** Determines the inclusion and display properties of SoD-related columns and details, like position change date, application-specific roles, and SoD violation indicators. Enhances the ability to monitor and audit user roles and permissions for any potential conflicts of interest within the application's environment.

**Example Scenario:** If an organization needs to closely monitor and mitigate SoD risks within their ERP systems, configuring this parameter to display detailed SoD data helps in identifying potential compliance issues quickly during review processes.

**Best Practices:** Configure when conducting in-depth compliance reviews or audits where visibility of SoD details directly influences the outcome. Avoid when minimal compliance reporting is required, or in environments where SoD risk is managed outside of the Pathlock platform.
