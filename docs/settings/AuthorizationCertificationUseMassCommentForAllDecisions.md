**Technical Name: AuthorizationCertificationUseMassCommentForAllDecisions**

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**
Enables the use of a single, overarching comment for all decisions in the authorization certification process within Pathlock's GRC platform.

**Business Impact:**
Streamlines the authorization certification process by allowing certifiers to apply a single comment to multiple decisions, thus enhancing efficiency and reducing the risk of inconsistent or omitted comments across related certification decisions.

**Technical Impact when configured:**
When this setting is configured, it affects the authorization certification workflow by enabling a mass comment feature. This allows a unified comment to be propagated across all items being certified simultaneously, ensuring uniformity and coherence in the audit trail.

**Examples Scenario:**
A manager is certifying a series of user roles and permissions as part of a quarterly review. Instead of adding individual comments for each certification decision, the manager utilizes the mass comment feature to note that all decisions were reviewed against the current project requirements and compliance standards, saving time and ensuring consistency.
