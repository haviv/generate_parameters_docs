# Campaigns Review Details Tab UAR Peer Analysis

**Technical Name:** CampaignsReviewDetailsTabUARPeerAnalysis

**Category:** Audit

**Default Value:** True

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The parameter `CampaignsReviewDetailsTabUARPeerAnalysis` controls the display and analysis of user access review (UAR) peer analysis within the Campaigns Review Details tab. When enabled, this feature allows the review of user roles and permissions in comparison to their peers within the organization, facilitating a more thorough audit and compliance process.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling this parameter helps in identifying anomalous permissions or roles that a user might possess compared to others in similar positions or within the same department. This comparison can highlight potential Segregation of Duties (SOD) conflicts or unnecessary access rights, thus mitigating risk and enhancing the organization's security posture.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- **Enabled:** Allows auditors and compliance managers to perform peer analysis during user access reviews. This can lead to more accurate access reviews, pinpointing discrepancies and anomalies effectively.
  
- **Disabled:** The peer analysis feature will not be available in the campaigns review details tab. This might speed up the review process but at the cost of potentially overlooking critical access-related risks.

**Example Scenario:**

An organization implements the `CampaignsReviewDetailsTabUARPeerAnalysis` parameter to improve their quarterly access review process. By enabling this feature, the compliance team identifies that several users in the finance department have access to systems and data that are not necessary for their roles, which their peers do not possess. This insight allows the organization to take corrective action, thereby reducing the potential risk of internal fraud.

**Best Practices:** Configure this parameter to be enabled in environments where detailed user access reviews are critical for maintaining security and compliance. Avoid enabling this feature in scenarios where user role variations are high and peer comparisons may not yield meaningful insights.
