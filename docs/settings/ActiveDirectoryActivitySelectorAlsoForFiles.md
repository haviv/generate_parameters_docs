**Description:**

This parameter controls whether activities related to file operations within the Active Directory environment should also be considered and tracked by the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It enables organizations to fine-tune the scope of activities they monitor for compliance, risk management, and security purposes.

**Business Impact:**

Inclusion of file operation activities in monitoring can significantly enhance the organization's visibility into user behaviors and data handling practices. This can be critical for detecting unauthorized access, data breaches, or non-compliant actions that could lead to financial losses, legal challenges, or reputational damage.

When enabled, the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform will extend its monitoring capabilities to include file access, modifications, and other file-related activities performed in the Active Directory. This ensures a comprehensive overview of user activities and enhances the organizationâ€™s ability to enforce security policies, comply with regulations, and mitigate risks associated with file handling.
