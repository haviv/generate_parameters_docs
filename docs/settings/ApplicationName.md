**Application Name**

**Technical Name:** ApplicationName

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `ApplicationName` parameter is used to specify and identify the application within the Pathlock GRC platform. It allows for the configuration and management of application-specific settings, roles, and permissions.

**Business Impact:**

Configuring the `ApplicationName` correctly is crucial for effective management of application-level security, compliance, and governance. It ensures that the right users have access to the right resources and that the application adheres to organizational policies and standards.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When the `ApplicationName` is configured, it directly impacts the segregation of roles, permissions, and settings at the application level. This allows for a more granular control and management of the application within the Pathlock GRC ecosystem.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Scenario 1:** An organization wants to ensure that only specific roles within their ERP system can access sensitive financial reports. Configuring the `ApplicationName` allows them to define and enforce these restrictions accurately.
  
- **Scenario 2:** In a multi-application environment, an administrator wants to update compliance settings specific to one application without affecting others. By setting the `ApplicationName` appropriately, they can target their changes accurately.

**Related Settings:**

- `aspnet_Role`: Defines roles within the context of the specified application, ensuring that access control and permissions are correctly managed.

**Best Practices:** configure when setting up new applications within the Pathlock platform to ensure correct access control and compliance settings. Avoid generic configurations that do not distinctly identify applications, leading to potential governance and security issues.
