# Flexible Approver Name Template

**Technical Name:** FlexibleApproverNameTemplate

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

This parameter controls the naming convention used for dynamically generated approval groups based on the Flexible Approver setup. It is utilized during the construction of approval workflows, specifically in scenarios where approvals might be required from a variety of different approvers not strictly defined within a traditional hierarchy.

**Business Impact:**

Having a flexible naming template for approvers enables organizations to adapt their approval workflows more precisely to their operational structure, enhancing the efficiency and speed of the approval process. This flexibility supports compliance with internal and external audit requirements by ensuring that the appropriate levels of oversight are applied consistently across different processes and departments.

**Technical Impact: when configured**

Upon configuration, the system will use this template to generate group names for approval processes that require flexibility beyond static approver lists. This affects how approver groups are identified, organized, and managed within the system, allowing for a more granular and dynamic approach to assigning approvers based on the specific requirements of each workflow instance.

**Examples Scenario:**

A company has a policy requiring financial transactions over a certain amount to be approved by a department manager. However, if the transaction is related to IT expenditures, it must also be reviewed by the IT department head. By utilizing the FlexibleApproverNameTemplate, the company can dynamically create approver groups such as "DeptManager_ITHead_Approval" to accommodate this rule, streamlining the workflow and ensuring compliance with internal control policies.

**Best Practices:** configure when flexibility in approval processes is required to meet complex organizational or compliance requirements; avoid when a simple, static approval process is sufficient.
