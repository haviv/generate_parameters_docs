**Technical Name:** UserOpenRequestsShowApprovalGroupName

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter controls the visibility of the Approval Group Name in the User Open Requests section within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. Enabling this setting will display the name of the approval group associated with each request, providing additional context for the requestor and approvers.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling this feature can enhance transparency and accountability in the approval process by making it clear which group or individuals are responsible for approving each request. This can lead to a more efficient review process, as requestors can directly reach out to the appropriate approvers if needed.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When this parameter is configured to show the approval group name, it affects how request information is presented to the user in the My Requests view. This may also have performance implications depending on the number of requests and the complexity of the associated approval workflows.

**Examples Scenario:**

Consider an organization that utilizes multiple approval groups for different types of access requests. By enabling the User Open Requests Show Approval Group Name, employees submitting requests can immediately see which group will handle their request, allowing for direct communication and potentially faster processing times.

**Best Practices:** Configure this setting to enhance transparency and accountability within your organization's request and approval processes. However, consider the impact on user experience and system performance. Avoid enabling this setting if there are concerns about overloading users with excessive information or if there are performance issues with loading approval group data.
