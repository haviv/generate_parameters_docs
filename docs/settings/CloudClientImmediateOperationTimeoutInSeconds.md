# Cloud Client Immediate Operation Timeout In Seconds

**Technical Name:** CloudClientImmediateOperationTimeoutInSeconds

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `CloudClientImmediateOperationTimeoutInSeconds` parameter specifies the time in seconds that the cloud client will wait for an immediate operation to complete before timing out. This setting is crucial for ensuring operational efficiency and preventing unnecessary delays in system processes.

**Business Impact:**

Proper configuration of this parameter can significantly impact the performance and reliability of cloud-based operations within the Pathlock GRC platform. Setting a value too low may lead to premature timeout errors, while setting a value too high could result in prolonged waits for operations that have failed or are not responding, impacting user experience and system throughput.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- When set appropriately, it ensures that operations either complete successfully within a reasonable timeframe or fail promptly, allowing for quicker recovery or retry mechanisms to be initiated.
- Helps in resource management by preventing cloud client operations from hanging indefinitely, which can tie up system resources and degrade overall system performance.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Example 1:** A cloud-based synchronization task that is expected to complete within 60 seconds is set with a `CloudClientImmediateOperationTimeoutInSeconds` of 30 seconds. This setting could cause the operation to timeout prematurely, failing to sync data as needed.
- **Example 2:** An intensive reporting operation that takes around 120 seconds to complete is given a timeout setting of 180 seconds. This ensures that the operation has ample time to complete successfully, improving reliability and data accuracy in reports.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** There is a known average time for immediate operations to complete. Setting the timeout just above this average can help in handling operations efficiently without premature timeouts.
- **Avoid when:** If operations have highly variable completion times without clear averages, a too-tight timeout could interrupt legitimate processes. In such cases, a more generous timeout might be necessary, alongside monitoring to optimize the setting over time.
