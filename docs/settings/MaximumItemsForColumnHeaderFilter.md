**Technical Name:** MaximumItemsForColumnHeaderFilter

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:** -1

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `MaximumItemsForColumnHeaderFilter` parameter controls the maximum number of items displayed in the column header filter within reports. This setting allows for performance optimization and user interface clarity by limiting the length of dropdown lists for filters.

**Business Impact:**

Setting an appropriate value for this parameter can significantly enhance user experience by preventing overwhelming dropdown lists with too many values. It ensures that report users can efficiently navigate and select filter options, particularly in datasets with a high volume of unique entries.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- A value set greater than the default indicates that the application will allow more items to be displayed in the dropdown filter lists, which could potentially slow down report rendering if the dataset is very large.
- A value set to the default or lower limits the items displayed, improving loading times but possibly restricting users' ability to filter data based on all available unique values.

**Examples Scenario:**

In a financial compliance report containing transactions spanning several years, setting the `MaximumItemsForColumnHeaderFilter` to a practical number such as 100 helps in managing the user interface efficiently. Users can filter based on the top 100 most frequent transaction types, countries, or parties involved, making the report simpler to navigate without overwhelming the dropdown lists with thousands of unique transaction identifiers.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when** you have reports with a significant number of unique values in a column, and it's essential to maintain report loading performance and user interface usability.
- **Avoid when** every unique column value is crucial for report filtering tasks, or if the dataset is small enough that performance and usability are not impacted.
