**Technical Name:** UpdateCachePeriodForCodeTables

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** 

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `UpdateCachePeriodForCodeTables` parameter controls the frequency at which the cache for code tables is refreshed. This setting ensures that the system uses the most up-to-date information without the need to manually clear the cache.

**Business Impact:**

Setting an optimal cache update period can significantly improve the application's performance by reducing database load and ensuring timely visibility of critical data changes. This is particularly important in environments where security, risk, and compliance data frequently changes and needs to reflect promptly in reports and audits.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- **Increased Performance:** By adjusting the cache refresh period, the system's overall responsiveness and data retrieval speed can be enhanced.
- **Data Timeliness:** Ensures that the latest data changes are available to users without compromising system performance.
- **Reduced Database Load:** Minimizes the number of direct queries to the database, thereby reducing the load and potential for performance bottlenecks.

**Examples Scenario:**

An organization requires immediate visibility of changes in their compliance data due to the fast-paced nature of their business and regulatory environment. By reducing the `UpdateCachePeriodForCodeTables` value, the time lag before these updates are reflected in the application and reports is minimized, ensuring that decision-makers always have access to the most current data.

**Best Practices:** 
- **Configure when:** The underlying data changes frequently, and up-to-date information is critical for decision-making.
- **Avoid when:** The system operates in a highly stable environment with infrequent changes, as overly frequent cache refreshes can unnecessarily consume system resources.
