# Sap Query Pre Fix

**Technical Name:** SAPQueryPreFix

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The SAPQueryPreFix parameter is designed to modify or prefix certain identifiers or records retrieved from SAP systems to accommodate integration, reporting, or analysis needs within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform.

**Business Impact:**

Utilizing the SAPQueryPreFix appropriately can streamline data processing, enhance reporting accuracy, and improve the efficiency of risk detection and compliance monitoring activities. Misconfiguration, however, might lead to incomplete or inaccurate data representation, affecting decision-making processes.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, this parameter impacts how data retrieved from SAP is processed and represented within the Pathlock platform, specifically in the contexts of system logs and RFC report records. It can adjust timestamps and other critical data points to align with server time or other specified requirements, ensuring data integrity and relevance.

**Examples Scenario:**

A scenario might involve setting the SAPQueryPreFix to adjust RFCCall timestamps to the local time zone of the corporate server. This ensures that when SAP system logs and RFC reports are viewed within the Pathlock GRC platform, all timestamps are consistent with those from other systems, simplifying audit trails and incident analysis.

- CommonSettings.Default.NotUsedDaysMediumLevel
- CommonSettings.Default.NotUsedDaysMediumLowLevel
- CommonSettings.Default.OrganizationStructureProvider

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when** integrating Pathlock with SAP systems to ensure that data representation aligns with organizational auditing and reporting requirements.
- **Avoid when** there is no clear requirement for data adjustment or when the default SAP data representation meets the organizational needs to minimize unnecessary complexity.
