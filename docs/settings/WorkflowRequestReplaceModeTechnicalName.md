**Technical Name: WorkflowRequestReplaceModeTechnicalName**

**Category: Workflow**

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level: Medium**

**Description:**
The WorkflowRequestReplaceModeTechnicalName parameter controls how user roles are managed within the start step of a workflow. Specifically, it determines whether a SAP role, if not already mapped to the current role mapping, should be added to the workflow instance for further action, without marking it for removal.

**Business Impact:**
Configuring this parameter correctly ensures efficient and accurate role management within workflows. It helps in preventing unnecessary role removals, thereby maintaining system integrity and security. Misconfiguration could lead to improper role assignment or removal, affecting system access and compliance.

**Technical Impact when configured:**
When configured, this parameter helps in maintaining a clean and precise role mapping throughout the workflow process. It ensures that only those roles which are not part of the current role mapping are considered for addition, avoiding duplication and potential access issues.

**Example Scenario:**
Imagine a scenario where a workflow is initiated for reviewing user access rights within an SAP system. The WorkflowRequestReplaceModeTechnicalName parameter is used to ensure that any role not currently assigned to a user but necessary for their tasks is added for review, without the risk of erroneously removing existing roles that are still relevant.

**Best Practices:** 
- Configure when initiating workflows that involve role assignments to ensure appropriate role management.
- Avoid configuring this setting without a clear understanding of the current role mappings to prevent unintended role assignments.
