# Sap Connector Create User Central User Administration Retries

**Technical Name:** SapConnectorCreateUserCUARetries

**Category:** User Management

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter controls the retry mechanism for creating users in SAP systems via the Central User Administration (CUA) when initial attempts fail. It is designed to handle errors gracefully by attempting the user creation process multiple times, as specified by this parameter. This functionality is crucial in scenarios where transient network issues or temporary SAP system unavailability may cause user creation to fail.

**Business Impact:**

Ensuring user creation processes complete successfully is critical for maintaining operational continuity and ensuring that new users can access SAP systems as required. A robust retry mechanism reduces the manual intervention needed to address user creation failures, enhancing efficiency and reducing the administrative overhead associated with user management.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured with an appropriate value, this setting optimally balances system performance with reliability. Too few retries might lead to unaddressed failures in user creation due to transient issues, whereas too many retries could result in unnecessary load on the SAP system.

**Example Scenario:**

Suppose a transient network issue causes the SAP CUA to be temporarily unreachable when a batch of new user creation requests is processed. With this parameter properly configured, the system will automatically retry the user creation process a set number of times, significantly increasing the chance of success without manual retriggering.

**Best Practices:** configure when the SAP system is known to have occasional, brief outages or is undergoing maintenance. Avoid configuring an excessively high value to prevent undue stress on the system resources.
