**Default Value:** True

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:** This parameter controls the visibility and functionality of the Segregation of Duties (SoD) history tab within the campaign review details. When enabled, it provides a comprehensive view of SoD violations and history directly related to specific roles within the authorization certification process.

**Business Impact:** Enabling this feature significantly enhances the oversight and management of SoD risks in the authorization certification process, allowing for proactive identification and mitigation of potential compliance and security risks associated with role assignments.

**Technical Impact when configured:** Upon activation, the system will display an additional tab within the campaign's review details section, dedicated to showing historical SoD violations. This allows for detailed analysis and review, aiding in the decision-making process for role certification.

**Examples Scenario:** An auditor reviewing user access and authorizations for compliance with internal controls selects a role to certify. With the CampaignsReviewDetailsTabSODHistory enabled, they can access a detailed report of past and current SoD violations associated with that role, enabling them to make an informed decision about the role's compliance status.
