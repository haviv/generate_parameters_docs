# Temporary files folder

**Technical Name:** TempFolder

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The Temporary Files Folder (TempFolder) parameter specifies the location on the server where temporary files generated by the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform are stored. This includes, but is not limited to, temporary reports, files awaiting processing, or any intermediate files created as part of the platform's operations.

**Business Impact:**

The configuration of this parameter can significantly impact the efficiency and security of the data processing workflows within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. Proper configuration ensures that temporary data is managed in a secure manner, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data leakage. Additionally, it helps in optimizing the overall performance of the system by ensuring that temporary files are stored in a location that is both secure and offers rapid access.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When properly configured, the TempFolder parameter ensures that:
- Temporary files are segregated from core application files, minimizing the risk of accidental deletion or modification of critical system files.
- Disk space on critical volumes is managed more efficiently, as temporary files can be directed to a volume with ample free space.
- System performance is optimized by reducing clutter and potential fragmentation on the primary application volume.

**Examples Scenario:**

A security audit identifies that temporary files containing sensitive information are not adequately protected. By configuring the TempFolder to point to a secure, encrypted volume with access controls, the organization can mitigate this risk.

**Best Practices:** 
- **Configure when:** You have a dedicated volume or partition for temporary data that offers high I/O performance and ample storage space. This is especially critical in high-volume environments where the system generates a significant amount of temporary files.
- **Avoid when:** Directing temporary files to a location that lacks sufficient storage space or is not regularly monitored for security vulnerabilities.
