**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** 

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** The `TechnicalNameForApproveText` parameter is used within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to control the text displayed to end-users during the approval or declination process in various workflow scenarios.

**Business Impact:** Modifying the `TechnicalNameForApproveText` can impact how users perceive and interact with the approval process, potentially affecting the decision-making clarity and overall user experience. It ensures that the context and implications of approval decisions are clearly communicated to decision-makers.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When configured, this parameter changes the default approval or declination text presented to users in pop-up dialogs across different workflows. This can be instrumental in ensuring that the language used aligns with the organization's internal protocols and clarity requirements.

**Examples Scenario:** If an organization prefers to use more formal language in their approval processes or if there is a need to specify additional instructions within the approval text, modifying the `TechnicalNameForApproveText` allows this customization. For example, changing the approval text to "Please confirm you have reviewed all risk implications before approving" could be implemented by adjusting this parameter.

**Best Practices:** configure when needing to tailor the approval process to better fit organizational terminology or to provide clearer instructions to approvers. Avoid when default settings meet organizational needs and clarity standards.
