**Default Value:** *Not Provided*

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter is utilized to configure the remark or notification content that is included in emails generated when a discrepancy in server settings or data is detected. It's primarily used to ensure that administrators are promptly alerted to potential issues that could affect the platform's operation or security.

**Business Impact:**

The configuration of this parameter directly impacts how quickly and effectively administrators can respond to and resolve discrepancies that could pose security risks or lead to data inconsistencies. By providing clear, timely, and actionable information, organizations can maintain the integrity and security of their GRC (Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance) processes.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, this parameter influences the content of discrepancy alert emails sent to administrators. It ensures that alerts are informative and highlight the urgency or importance of the discrepancy, enabling quicker decision-making and response actions.

**Example Scenario:**

Suppose a discrepancy is detected in user permissions that deviates from the established compliance policies within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. An email alert containing the configured remark (Astrisk Remark) is sent to the system administrator, detailing the discrepancy's nature, impacted areas, and suggesting immediate review. This prompt notification allows the administrator to quickly address the issue, preventing potential security or compliance breaches.
