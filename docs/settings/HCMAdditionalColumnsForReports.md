# HCMAdditional Columns For Reports

**Technical Name:** HCMAdditionalColumnsForReports

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:** Not Specified

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** 

This parameter allows for the customization of report columns specifically for Human Capital Management (HCM). By enabling additional columns, users can tailor reports to include detailed employee-related information, enhancing the analytical and monitoring capabilities of HR processes.

**Business Impact:**

Incorporating additional columns into reports empowers HR and compliance teams to gain a deeper understanding of employee actions, information types, subtypes, and terminal access history. This enriched data supports better decision-making, aids in audit preparations, and enhances compliance with regulatory requirements or internal policies.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Upon configuration, the HCMAdditionalColumnsForReports parameter dynamically expands the data fields included in reports. This includes but is not limited to audit action descriptions, information types, sub-information descriptions, and IP addresses (terminal information), facilitating a comprehensive overview of the HCM landscape.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Audit Preparation:** The HR department is preparing for an upcoming audit and needs to ensure that all employee actions and information are accurately logged and accessible. Including detailed columns like `AuditActionsDesc`, `InfoTypeDesc`, and `IP` enables auditors to easily verify compliance with internal controls and external regulations.
  
- **Security Monitoring:** To enhance security monitoring efforts, IT and HR teams decide to include `SubInfDesc` and `Terminal` information in their reports. This allows for the detection and investigation of any unauthorized or anomalous access attempts, thus improving the overall security posture of the organization.

**Related Settings:** 

- CustomReportSeperator: Defines the separator character used in custom reports, which can affect how additional column data is presented and parsed.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** Enhanced report detail is necessary for audit, compliance, security monitoring, or in-depth HR analysis.
- **Avoid when:** Minimal reporting is sufficient, or if the inclusion of additional data columns could overwhelm users or complicate report interpretation.
