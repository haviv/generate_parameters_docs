**Technical Name:** StatusFileName

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:** Not specified

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `StatusFileName` parameter is responsible for defining the name of a temporary file used to log updates and exceptions in the system. This is part of the reporting module within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. The usage of this parameter ensures that any modifications or errors encountered during runtime are adequately documented, allowing for easier debugging and system monitoring.

**Business Impact:**

Proper configuration of the `StatusFileName` enhances the organization's ability to monitor system health, track changes, and identify issues promptly. This supports risk management efforts by ensuring that exceptions do not go unnoticed and that system changes are recorded for audit purposes.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- Facilitates effective logging of system updates and exceptions.
- Supports system monitoring by maintaining a record of critical runtime events.
- Aids in troubleshooting and debugging by providing detailed contextual information about errors.

**Examples Scenario:**

A system administrator is investigating an unexpected error that occurred during a data synchronization process. By reviewing the logs in the file defined by `StatusFileName`, the administrator can identify the exact point of failure and the data involved, accelerating the diagnosis and resolution of the issue.

**Related Settings:** 

- `Logger.SaveExceptionToLog` (indicates integration with the system's logging mechanism)
- `FileUtilities.GetTempFileName` (suggests the parameter influences the naming of temporary files used for logging purposes)

**Best Practices:** configure when the system is initially set up to ensure early capture of potential issues; avoid altering during critical operations to maintain logging continuity.
