**Technical Name:** TechnicalNameForJobRole

**Category:** User Management

**Default Value:** 

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

The `TechnicalNameForJobRole` parameter is used within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to dynamically determine relevant SAP roles for a user based on the context of a specific workflow instance. This functionality is crucial for ensuring that users are granted appropriate access rights, aligned with their job responsibilities and the current workflow requirements.

**Business Impact:**

Proper configuration of the `TechnicalNameForJobRole` parameter ensures that users have access to necessary resources and functionalities required to perform their duties efficiently and securely. It plays a vital role in minimizing the risk of unauthorized access, thereby protecting sensitive information and maintaining compliance with relevant regulations and policies.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- Dynamically adjusts user roles based on workflow context, enhancing security and compliance.
- Ensures users have appropriate access for the duration of the workflow, improving efficiency and safeguarding against potential security breaches.
- Facilitates smoother operations and user experience by automating role adjustments, reducing the need for manual intervention.

**Examples Scenario:**

A user is involved in a financial approval workflow where they temporarily require access to the SAP financial module to approve expenditures. The `TechnicalNameForJobRole` parameter would dynamically adjust the user's role to include this access for the duration of the approval process. Once the workflow is completed, the temporary access is revoked, ensuring that access rights are always aligned with current job responsibilities and workflows.

**Related Settings:**

- `UseTransactionHistoryFromCaching`: This setting controls whether transaction history data should be fetched from cache, which can impact the performance and real-time accuracy of role adjustments made by the `TechnicalNameForJobRole` parameter.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** setting up workflows that require dynamic adjustment of user roles to ensure users have the necessary access to complete their tasks efficiently and securely. 
- **Avoid when:** the adjustment of user roles does not rely on workflow context or when access rights are static and do not require changes during workflows.
