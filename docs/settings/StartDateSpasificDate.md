# Default 'start date' filter value

**Technical Name:** StartDateSpasificDate

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

Configures a specific default starting date for reporting and analysis functions within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This setting ensures that when users generate reports or analyze data, they begin from this predefined date unless specified otherwise by the user.

**Business Impact:**

Having a pre-configured start date ensures consistency across reports and analyses, facilitating easier trend observation and comparison over time. It also enhances user experience by streamlining the data selection process, particularly beneficial in compliance and audit preparation tasks where specific reporting periods are required.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Once set, this parameter automatically pre-fills the start date field in reporting and analysis tools with the specified date. It helps in narrowing down the data range for reports and analyses, potentially reducing processing time and focusing on the most relevant data.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Audit Preparation:** An organization can set this default start date to the beginning of their fiscal year. Doing so allows auditors and compliance officers to quickly generate annual reports without manually setting the start date each time.
  
- **Monthly Analysis:** Companies can configure the parameter to the start of the current month for routine financial or security monitoring, ensuring consistent periodical assessments without manual intervention.

- `EventsDetailsTableText`

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** you have standardized reporting periods (e.g., fiscal years, quarters) or wish to streamline the data analysis process for specific time frames.
  
- **Avoid when:** reporting periods are highly variable or if reports often require customization beyond standard time frames. Customization for unique reporting needs could be hindered by a pre-set start date.
