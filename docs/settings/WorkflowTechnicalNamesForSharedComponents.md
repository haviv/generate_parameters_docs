**Workflow Technical Names For Shared Components**

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** N/A

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter is used to define technical names for shared components within workflows. Shared components can include entities such as risk subtypes and risk levels, pertaining to the Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) framework. It is used mainly in the configuration of smart query sections which leverage these components for analytical and reporting purposes.

**Business Impact:**

Accurate configuration of this parameter ensures that reports, dashboards, and analyses reflect the correct risk subtypes and levels, enabling more accurate risk assessments and compliance reporting. Misconfiguration can lead to incorrect risk categorization, impacting decision-making and regulatory compliance status.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Proper configuration allows for the customization and extension of workflow capabilities, enhancing the platform's utility in risk management, compliance processes, and audit trails. It enables the effective segmentation of risks and their levels, aiding in detailed and nuanced GRC analysis.

**Examples Scenario:**

- Configuring `WorkflowTechnicalNamesForSharedComponents` to include specific risk subtypes and risk levels. This allows an organization to tailor the Pathlock GRC platform to its unique risk landscape, making the platformâ€™s risk management capabilities more relevant and precise.

**Related Settings:**

- `DisableApprovalOfAuthorizationSetReports`
- `LdapFilter`

**Best Practices:** 

- **configure when**: You need to ensure that workflow components are accurately represented according to your organization's risk management framework.
  
- **avoid when**: If default settings meet your organization's requirements for GRC management, customization may not be necessary and could complicate system maintenance.
