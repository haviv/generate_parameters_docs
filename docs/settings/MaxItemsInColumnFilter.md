# Max Items In Column Filter

**Technical Name:** MaxItemsInColumnFilter

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:** Not provided in the code references.

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The Max Items In Column Filter parameter controls the maximum number of items that can be displayed within a column filter in reports generated by the Pathlock GRC platform. This setting is particularly crucial for optimizing the performance and usability of report filters where large datasets are involved.

**Business Impact:**

Setting an appropriate limit for the Max Items In Column Filter can significantly enhance the reporting experience by preventing performance degradation and improving the usability of reports. It ensures that end users can navigate and use filters efficiently, especially in scenarios where columns may contain a large number of unique values.

**Technical Impact: when configured**

Proper configuration of this parameter directly influences the loading times and responsiveness of the reporting interface. By limiting the number of items listed in each column's filter dropdown, system resources are used more efficiently, which can lead to quicker report generation times and a smoother user interaction with the platform.

**Examples Scenario:**

In a situation where a report column contains thousands of unique employee names, setting the Max Items In Column Filter to a reasonable number, like 100, would ensure that the dropdown filter for this column remains responsive and does not overload the user with too many options.

**Best Practices:** 

Configure when:
- Dealing with report columns expected to contain a large number of unique values. It prevents the dropdown filters from becoming overcrowded and unmanageable.

Avoid when:
- The dataset within each column is small, or the uniqueness of items is limited. In such cases, adjusting this parameter might not provide significant benefits and could potentially limit the visibility of available filters unnecessarily.
