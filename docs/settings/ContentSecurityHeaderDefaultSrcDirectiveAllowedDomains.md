**Technical Name:** ContentSecurityHeaderDefaultSrcDirectiveAllowedDomains

**Category:** Security

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

This parameter is used to define the domains that are allowed as sources for default content security policy (CSP) directives. It controls which origins content can be loaded from, enhancing the security by preventing content injection attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Business Impact:**

Proper configuration of this parameter helps in safeguarding the application from loading potentially malicious content from unauthorized sources. It strengthens the application's defense against content injection attacks, protecting both the organization's data and its users' data from being compromised.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, it restricts the HTTP response header's `default-src` directive in Content Security Policy to only allow domains explicitly specified. This ensures that all content including JavaScript, CSS, and image files, are loaded only from the listed sources, mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.

**Examples Scenario:**

For an organization that uses multiple subdomains and external APIs for analytics or UI components, specifying those trusted domains ensures that content can only be loaded from these sources. For instance, configuring this parameter to accept domains such as `*.companydomain.com` and `analyticsapi.com` would restrict content loading strictly to these specified domains.

**Related Settings:**

- ContentSecurityHeaderCustomSpecificationEnabled

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** Setting up security policies for a new application or reviewing existing application security measures. Specify all trusted domains, including subdomains and external APIs used by the application.
  
- **Avoid when:** If not properly configured, this policy could inadvertently block legitimate content sources, leading to application functionalities breaking. Ensure thorough testing is conducted before deployment.
