# Auto Complete Minimum Prefix Length

**Technical Name:** AutoCompleteMinimumPrefixLength

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** 

**Impact Level:** Low

**Description:** This parameter defines the minimum number of characters a user must enter before the auto-complete suggestions are displayed. 

**Business Impact:** Reducing the number of unnecessary or irrelevant suggestions can enhance user experience by providing more accurate and efficient completion options, particularly when dealing with a large volume of data entries or complex data sets. 

**Technical Impact when configured:** Improves the performance of auto-complete functionality by limiting the number of queries sent to the server, thus reducing load and potentially speeding up the response time for relevant suggestions.

**Example Scenario:** When a user starts typing a username in a search field within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform, the auto-complete functionality will only trigger after the minimum number of characters specified by this setting has been entered. For example, if the `AutoCompleteMinimumPrefixLength` is set to 3, typing "Jo" won't bring up any suggestions, but as soon as "Joh" is entered, it will start showing names like John, Johan, etc.

**Best Practices:** 
- **configure when:** the environment involves large datasets or if the auto-complete feature returns too many irrelevant suggestions, which could overwhelm the users.
- **avoid when:** immediate suggestions are crucial for enhancing user experience or if the dataset is relatively small, where showing suggestions early might be beneficial.
