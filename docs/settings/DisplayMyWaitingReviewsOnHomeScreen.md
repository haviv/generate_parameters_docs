**Examples Scenario:**

Jane Doe logs into the Pathlock GRC platform after enabling the 'Display My Waiting Reviews On Home Screen' feature.

Recognizing one as a high-priority request she had been awaiting, she reviews and completes it immediately, significantly reducing the time it would typically take to process such requests.
