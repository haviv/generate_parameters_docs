# Comment For Apply Changes Through Authorization Simulation

**Technical Name:** CommentForApplyChangesThroughAuthorizationSimulation

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** ""

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `CommentForApplyChangesThroughAuthorizationSimulation` parameter is used within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to provide contextual information or rationale for changes proposed through the authorization simulation feature. It is primarily utilized within the ProfileTailor application for enhancing decision-making during authorization changes within SAP roles.

**Business Impact:**

Including comments with proposed changes aids in the transparency and accountability of decisions related to user access and role modifications. It supports compliance efforts by ensuring all changes are auditable and justifiable, reflecting directly on the organization's security posture and its adherence to internal and external governance standards.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, this parameter ensures that every simulated change to authorizations, especially within sensitive SAP roles such as HR, QueryGroup, and Position roles, is accompanied by a rationale. This information can be pivotal during audit trails, where understanding the reasoning behind changes is necessary for compliance verification.

**Examples Scenario:**

A security analyst wants to simulate an authorization change that grants additional access rights within the HR SAP role to a specific user. Using the `CommentForApplyChangesThroughAuthorizationSimulation` parameter, the analyst can attach a comment explaining the necessity of this change, such as "Required to provide Mr. John Doe with access to additional HR records due to expanded job responsibilities."

**Best Practices:** configure when implementing any changes through authorization simulation to ensure each change is documented with a clear rationale. Avoid when changes are routine, minor, or do not affect security or compliance postures to prevent information overload.
