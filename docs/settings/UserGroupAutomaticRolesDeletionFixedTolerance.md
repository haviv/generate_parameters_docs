**User Group Automatic Roles Deletion Fixed Tolerance**

**Technical Name:** UserGroupAutomaticRolesDeletionFixedTolerance

**Category:** User Management

**Default Value:** 0

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter controls the tolerance level for automatic deletion of roles within user groups based on specific criteria. It dictates how the system manages changes in role assignments within SAP environments, especially focusing on the automatic updating or removal of roles that are no longer applicable.

**Business Impact:**

Ensuring that roles are accurately assigned and automatically updated or removed when not applicable is crucial for maintaining system security and compliance. Mismanagement of roles can lead to unauthorized access or the failure to comply with regulations, potentially resulting in security breaches and compliance violations.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Configuring this parameter impacts the system's approach to handling user group role assignments in SAP environments. It determines the system's tolerance for automatically deleting roles that do not meet specific conditions, thereby influencing how dynamically the system can respond to changes in user access requirements.

**Examples Scenario:**

If the `UserGroupAutomaticRolesDeletionFixedTolerance` is set to a higher value, the system might retain roles within user groups for longer, even if certain criteria for these roles are no longer met, offering a buffer period during which adjustments can be made. Conversely, a lower tolerance level results in a stricter, more immediate cleanup of roles that no longer fit the predefined criteria, ensuring a tighter control over role assignments.

**Best Practices:** configure when

- The business requires tight control over role assignments and compliance adherence.
- There's a need for dynamic adjustment of user access based on changing roles and permissions within the organization.

avoid when

- The organization has less dynamic role assignment needs and changes to role assignments are infrequent.
- There is a risk of inadvertently removing access due to strict tolerance levels, which might interrupt user operations or access to critical systems.
