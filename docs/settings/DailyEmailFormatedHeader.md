**Technical Name:** DailyEmailFormatedHeader

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `DailyEmailFormatedHeader` parameter is part of the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform's email reporting feature. It allows for the customization of the header section in daily event summary emails generated by the platform. This parameter plays a vital role in tailoring the presentation of emailed reports to better meet organizational branding or informational needs.

**Business Impact:**

A well-defined email header can enhance the readability and effectiveness of daily event summaries. By customizing this, organizations are able to emphasize certain aspects of their reports, conform to corporate branding, and make the emailed summaries more recognizable and actionable to recipients. The visual and informational consistency achieved through this customization aids in ensuring that critical compliance, risk management, and security information is readily accessible and engaging.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When the `DailyEmailFormatedHeader` parameter is configured, each email generated for the daily event summary will include the specified formatting and content at the top of the email body. This can include customized text, layout adjustments, or branding elements that align the report's appearance with organizational standards or preferences.

**Examples Scenario:**

- A company wants to include their company logo and a custom welcome message in the header of their daily event summary emails to reinforce brand identity and communicate specific priorities or reminders to the report recipients.

**Related Settings:**

- `DailyEmailConfig`: Defines general configurations for the events summary mail, including recipient and frequency settings.
- `DailyEmailFooter`: Configurable parameter for customizing the footer content in daily event summary emails, often used in conjunction with the `DailyEmailFormatedHeader` for a complete custom email layout.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** your organization requires branded communication or when specific instructions or highlights need to be communicated at the beginning of each report.
- **Avoid when:** default settings meet your organizational needs or in cases where email simplicity is prioritized over branding and customization.
