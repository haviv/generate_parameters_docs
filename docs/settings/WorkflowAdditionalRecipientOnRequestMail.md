# Workflow Additional Recipient On Request Mail

**Technical Name:** WorkflowAdditionalRecipientOnRequestMail

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter allows the specification of additional recipients for emails generated by workflow actions within the Pathlock GRC platform. When a workflow action that involves sending an email is triggered, the specified recipients in this parameter are also included in the email communication, in addition to the primary recipients.

**Business Impact:**

Incorporating additional stakeholders or departments as recipients in the workflow-generated emails ensures that all relevant parties are kept informed about the workflow progress, critical actions, decisions, or approvals. This can lead to better coordination, timely responses, and enhanced compliance with internal and external regulations.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When set, the additional recipients specified will receive emails generated by workflow actions. This helps in broadening the communication reach, ensuring transparency, and involving more stakeholders in the process without manual intervention.

**Example Scenario:**

A security workflow is initiated to address a detected vulnerability. By including the IT security team and relevant department heads as additional recipients via this parameter, they immediately receive notifications about the initiation of the workflow, steps taken, and any requests for action or information, thus facilitating quicker resolution and compliance tracking.
