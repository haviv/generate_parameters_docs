**Technical Name:** ActiveDirectorySecondaryProviderAdditionalFields

**Category:** User Management

**Default Value:** None

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The parameter `ActiveDirectorySecondaryProviderAdditionalFields` refers to configurable fields specifically for enterprises leveraging a secondary Active Directory (AD) provider within Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This setting enables organizations to further customize and extend the integration of their Active Directory setup with Pathlock's cloud-based governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) capabilities, especially in scenarios where multiple AD domains or structures are involved.

**Business Impact:**

Configuring additional fields for a secondary AD provider enhances the organization's ability to accurately reflect its user management and organizational hierarchy within the Pathlock platform. It enables more granular control over the synchronization and governance of user identities and permissions, directly impacting security policies, compliance posture, and risk management processes.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- Enhanced integration with multi-domain Active Directory environments.
- Improved accuracy in user role assignments and access permissions.
- Ability to tailor the Pathlock GRC platform integration to specific organizational structures or requirements that are not covered by the primary AD provider settings.

**Example Scenario:**

An organization uses a primary AD domain for most users but has acquired another company that operates under a separate AD domain. By configuring the `ActiveDirectorySecondaryProviderAdditionalFields`, the organization can ensure that users from both domains are properly managed and governed under the same GRC policies within Pathlock, without compromising on the specific nuances and requirements of the secondary domain.

**Related Settings:**

- ActiveDirectorySecondaryProviderAdditinalDomains
- ActiveDirectorySecondaryProviderEnableActiveDirectoryOrgStrctureBasedOnManagers

**Best Practices:** 

- Configure when managing users across multiple Active Directory domains to ensure comprehensive GRC coverage.
- Avoid when a single Active Directory domain sufficiently meets the organization's GRC integration needs to simplify the configuration.
