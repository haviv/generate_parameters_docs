**PTDM Logo Path**

**Technical Name:** PTDM_LogoPath

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** (No default value specified in the provided references)

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** 

The `PTDM_LogoPath` parameter is used within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform for configuring the path location of the logo image file. This logo can be displayed on various reports, interfaces, or any customer-facing documentation generated by the platform.

**Business Impact:**

Customizing the logo through the `PTDM_LogoPath` allows businesses to maintain branding consistency across all security, risk, and compliance reports or documents generated by Pathlock. This aids in reinforcing brand identity and ensures that all communications are professional and brand-compliant.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When the `PTDM_LogoPath` is configured, the Pathlock GRC platform displays the specified logo instead of the default or previously set logo. This path directs the platform to the location of the image file to be used across the platform's interfaces and documents.

**Examples Scenario:**

1. **Branding Update:** A company rebrands, including a new logo. The `PTDM_LogoPath` parameter is updated to reflect the path of the new logo image, ensuring all GRC-related documents reflect the current brand identity.
  
2. **Initial Configuration:** Upon first setting up the Pathlock platform, the IT team sets the `PTDM_LogoPath` to ensure all generated reports carry the company's logo for a professional appearance from the start.

**Best Practices:** configure when initiating the platform setup or after a rebranding to ensure consistent branding. Avoid configuring this parameter without having the correct permissions or without verifying the logo's path and file compatibility.
