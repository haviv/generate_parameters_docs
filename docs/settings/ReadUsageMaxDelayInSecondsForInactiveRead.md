# Read Usage Max Delay In Seconds For Inactive Read

**Technical Name:** ReadUsageMaxDelayInSecondsForInactiveRead

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `ReadUsageMaxDelayInSecondsForInactiveRead` parameter controls the maximum delay, in seconds, before considering a log read action as inactive. This setting is critical for managing the performance and reliability of log analysis operations within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It directly impacts how the system handles data that is being processed for security, risk, and compliance insights but has not completed due to various reasons such as system errors or interruptions.

**Business Impact:**

Setting an optimal value for this parameter ensures that log reads are timely processed or flagged as inactive, allowing system administrators and security professionals to address any potential issues swiftly. It helps maintain the integrity of audit trails and compliance reports, ensuring that all actions are accounted for within the defined SLA periods. This, in turn, supports compliance with regulations that require timely processing and review of security logs.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- **Performance Improvement:** By identifying and handling inactive log reads promptly, system resources are optimized, preventing unnecessary allocation of processing power to tasks that cannot be completed.
- **Error Management:** Facilitates better tracking and management of errors in log processing, allowing for quicker resolutions to interruptions or system anomalies.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensures that the data used for compliance and security analysis is current and accurately reflects the system's state, reducing the risk of overlooking potential compliance issues or security threats.

**Examples Scenario:**

A user sets `ReadUsageMaxDelayInSecondsForInactiveRead` to a value that aligns with their SLA for processing security logs. If a log read operation does not complete within this timeframe, it is marked as inactive. This trigger alerts the IT team to investigate the delay, possibly revealing a configuration issue on the log source or a network latency problem, ensuring that the issue is resolved promptly to maintain compliance with data protection standards.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:**
    - You are experiencing delays in log processing that impact compliance reporting or security analysis.
    - You have defined SLAs for log read operations and need to ensure these are met.
- **Avoid when:**
    - System resources are limited, and increasing the frequency of checks for inactive reads may lead to performance degradation.
    - If your environment does not experience significant delays in log processing, adjusting this parameter may not provide substantial benefits.
