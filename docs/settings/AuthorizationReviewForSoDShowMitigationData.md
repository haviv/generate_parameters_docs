**Technical Name:** AuthorizationReviewForSoDShowMitigationData

**Category:** SOD

**Default Value:** 

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

This parameter controls the display of mitigation data related to Segregation of Duties (SoD) within authorization reviews. When enabled, it allows users to view detailed mitigation information directly within the review process, facilitating a more informed decision-making process regarding user access rights and SoD conflict resolutions.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling this parameter can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the risk management process by providing immediate access to necessary mitigation data. This aids in ensuring compliance with internal policies and regulatory requirements by allowing for quick identification and resolution of potential access control issues.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Upon activation, this parameter alters the behavior of the authorization review interface to include detailed mitigation data pertaining to SoD conflicts. This enhancement supports risk officers and reviewers in making more informed decisions by readily providing the context and actions taken to mitigate identified risks.

**Examples Scenario:**

An organization is undergoing an internal audit and needs to prove that SoD conflicts identified in their ERP system have been properly mitigated. By enabling this parameter, auditors can efficiently review each conflict along with its mitigation directly within the authorization review interface, streamlining the audit process and supporting compliance requirements.
