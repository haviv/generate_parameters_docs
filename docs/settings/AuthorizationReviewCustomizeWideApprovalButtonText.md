**Technical Name:** AuthorizationReviewCustomizeWideApprovalButtonText

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** This parameter allows the customization of the text displayed on the wide approval button within the authorization review process. It enables organizations to tailor the button text to better match their internal terminology or language preferences, enhancing the user experience and clarity in the authorization certification workflow.

**Business Impact:** Customizing the approval button text can directly affect the efficiency and clarity of the authorization review process. Clearly labeled buttons can lead to fewer mistakes, faster processing times, and a smoother experience for users involved in managing or responding to authorization reviews. This customization can be particularly impactful in organizations with specific compliance requirements or in non-English speaking environments where localized terminology is preferred.

**Technical Impact when configured:** Once configured, the customized text will replace the default button text in all instances of the wide approval button across authorization review pages. This change can improve user navigation and decision-making during the review process by using language that is more familiar or relevant to the specific audience.

**Examples Scenario:** In a multi-national corporation, the authorization review process involves participants from various countries. The company decides to customize the approval button text to "Approve All Requests" in English and the equivalent in other languages based on the user's locale. This change makes the process more intuitive for non-English speakers and streamlines the review process.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** You need to enhance clarity and usability for users involved in the authorization review process, especially in environments with specific language or terminology preferences.
  
- **Avoid when:** The default button text is sufficient for your organization's needs, or if the customization could introduce confusion or inconsistency within the user interface.
