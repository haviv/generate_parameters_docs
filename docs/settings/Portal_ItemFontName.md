# Portal - Font Name

**Technical Name:** Portal_ItemFontName

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** (No explicit default value provided in the given code references)

**Impact Level:** Low

**Description:**

The `Portal_ItemFontName` parameter allows for the customization of font type across various elements within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform user interface. This setting is instrumental in aligning the platform's visual presentation with organizational branding guidelines and enhancing readability for users.

**Business Impact:**

Adjusting the font name can significantly influence the user experience by ensuring consistency with corporate branding and making the interface more accessible and easier to read, potentially increasing user engagement and compliance with platform tasks.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, this parameter alters the default font used within the Portal, affecting how text is displayed across all user-facing elements. This includes, but is not limited to, menu items, headers, and body text throughout the platform.

**Example Scenario:**

Suppose an organization, ACME Corp, has strict branding guidelines that include the use of a specific font, "ACME Gothic", across all digital products and platforms. By configuring `Portal_ItemFontName` to "ACME Gothic", ACME Corp ensures that the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform aligns with its corporate identity, enhancing the user's sense of familiarity and reducing visual friction.
