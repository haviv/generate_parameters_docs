# Authorization Request Status

**Technical Name:** AuthorizationRequestStatus

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** N/A

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

The `AuthorizationRequestStatus` parameter is used to track the status of an authorization request within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This mechanism is critical for ensuring that the steps in a workflow pertaining to gaining approvals, re-approvals, or any form of authorizations are properly managed and recorded.

**Business Impact:**

Managing the status of authorization requests is crucial for maintaining compliance and ensuring that access to sensitive information and systems is properly controlled. Incorrect handling of these requests could lead to unauthorized access, potential data breaches, and non-compliance with regulatory standards.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Proper configuration of this parameter directly affects the efficiency of approval workflows, emergency access procedures, and the overall auditability of access management processes. It helps in clearly delineating the state of any request at any given time, facilitating quick decisions and actions.

**Example Scenario:**

Consider a scenario where an employee needs emergency access to a restricted system for resolving an urgent issue. The `AuthorizationRequestStatus` would be initiated at the time of request submission, tracked through the approval or denial stages, and finally updated upon the completion of the request lifecycleâ€”enabling transparency and traceability of the emergency access provisioned.

**Best Practices:** configure when implementing any workflow that requires authorization steps to ensure that each request is tracked and acted upon appropriately; avoid when there is no need for tracking authorization requests as it could introduce unnecessary complexity into the system.
