**Technical Name:** Azure_ClientId

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** 

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:** The Azure_ClientId parameter is utilized within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform for authenticating and enabling secure communication with Azure services. This parameter uniquely identifies the Azure application within the Directory and is central to the OAuth and OpenID Connect protocols implemented for secure access.

**Business Impact:** Proper configuration of the Azure_ClientId ensures that Pathlock Cloud GRC platform users can securely authenticate with Azure AD, enabling seamless integration with Azure's cloud services. This is critical for maintaining secure access controls, meeting compliance requirements, and facilitating a secure environment for managing governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) activities.

**Technical Impact when configured:**  When properly configured, the Azure_ClientId allows for the secure authentication and authorization of users via OAuth and OpenID Connect protocols. This setup enables Pathlock Cloud GRC to reliably interact with Azure services, ensuring that sensitive operations and data access are securely managed.

**Example Scenario:** In a scenario where an organization seeks to integrate Pathlock Cloud GRC with its Azure-managed resources, setting the Azure_ClientId correctly is a prerequisite. For example, an organization implementing this parameter would ensure that its users can securely authenticate against Azure AD when accessing GRC-related functionalities, thus streamlining the risk management processes and leveraging Azure's security capabilities.
