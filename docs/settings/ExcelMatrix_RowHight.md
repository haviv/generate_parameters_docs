**Technical Name:** ExcelMatrix_RowHeight

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:** 25

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The ExcelMatrix_RowHeight parameter is designed to adjust the row height within Excel matrices generated by the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This setting ensures the content is visually accessible and neatly organized, aiding in the accurate presentation of compliance and risk management data.

**Business Impact:**

Adjusting the row height impacts how data is displayed in Excel reports. Proper configuration improves readability and comprehensibility of the data, which is crucial for making informed decisions based on security, risk, and compliance analytics.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When properly configured, enhances the clarity of Excel reports by ensuring that text and data are appropriately spaced. It prevents overlap and assures that content within each cell is fully visible, aiding in the interpretation of critical GRC information.

**Example Scenario:**

Consider a scenario where an organization generates a report on user access controls within its IT systems. If the default row height is insufficient to display all user roles and permissions neatly, adjusting the ExcelMatrix_RowHeight to accommodate longer text strings can make the report more readable and useful for audit purposes.
