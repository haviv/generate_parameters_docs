**Technical Name:** WorkflowRequestForwardOnDateTechnicalName

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** None

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter is used to define the specific date on which a workflow request should be automatically forwarded to the next step in the process. It is part of the Pathlock Cloud GRC's workflow automation capabilities, facilitating time-based progression of tasks without manual intervention.

**Business Impact:**

Implementing this parameter can significantly streamline workflow processes by ensuring that requests move forward in a timely manner, preventing bottlenecks and delays in critical GRC-related activities. It enhances the efficiency of managing compliance, risk mitigation, and audit processes by making sure that tasks are acted upon by the designated date.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, this parameter triggers the automatic forwarding of a workflow request to the next step as soon as the specified date is reached. It operates within the broader context of workflow actions, specifically "ForwardToNextStepOnSpecificDate" and "ForwardRequestOnUserIdle," ensuring a smoother and more predictable flow of tasks.

**Example Scenario:**

Consider a scenario where a compliance report needs review and approval by multiple departments before a quarterly deadline. By setting the WorkflowRequestForwardOnDateTechnicalName, each phase of the review process can be automatically advanced to the next responsible party on predetermined dates, ensuring the final approval is obtained well before the deadline.

**Related Settings:**

- `ForwardToNextStepOnSpecificDate`
- `ForwardRequestOnUserIdle`

**Applicable Workflows Actions:**

- ForwardToNextStepOnSpecificDate

**Best Practices:** configure when:

- There is a clear schedule and deadline by which workflow steps need to be completed.
- Workflow tasks depend on timely progression for compliance or risk management purposes.

avoid when:

- Tasks require flexible timelines due to unpredictable workloads or dependencies.
- Direct oversight and manual intervention are preferred to ensure task completion.
