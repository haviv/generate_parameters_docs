# Remediation Workflows

**Technical Name:** RemediationWorkflowsSOD

**Category:** SOD (Segregation of Duties)

**Default Value:** Not specified

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

The Remediation Workflows parameter is designed to streamline the process of managing and mitigating segregation of duties (SOD) conflicts within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It enables organizations to automate the workflow for identifying, assessing, and remediating SOD risks in their enterprise systems.

**Business Impact:**

Properly configured remediation workflows significantly reduce the time and effort required to manage SOD risks, ensuring compliance with internal policies and external regulations. This automation helps in prioritizing high-risk areas, thereby minimizing potential financial and reputational damage caused by SOD violations.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- Allows for the automation of risk detection and remediation processes.
- Facilitates the assignment of remediation tasks to appropriate stakeholders.
- Provides a systematic approach to tracking and documenting remediation efforts and outcomes.
- Enhances visibility into SOD risk status and remediation progress.

**Examples Scenario:**

A company implements the Remediation WorkflowsSOD parameter to automate the process of handling conflicts arising from Financial Transactions being approved by the same person tasked with reconciling accounts. The workflow automatically flags the conflict, assigns a remediation task to the compliance team, and tracks the resolution process.

**Related Settings:** Not applicable

**Best Practices:** 

- **configure when** setting up the GRC platform for the first time or when updating the organizationâ€™s approach to SOD risk management. 
- **avoid when** the organization does not have clearly defined policies or procedures for SOD risk management, as this might lead to ineffective remediation workflows.
