**Default Value:** True

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** 

This setting controls whether users can edit their email addresses within their profile settings on the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. Enabling this feature allows users to update their email address, whereas disabling it restricts this capability.

**Business Impact:** 

Enabling users to edit their email addresses can enhance user experience by allowing for easy updates when their primary email changes. However, it might pose a security risk if not managed correctly, as unauthorized changes could lead to communication or access issues.

**Technical Impact when configured:** 

Configuring this setting to `True` allows all users to update their email address in their profile. Setting it to `False` will lock the email field, preventing any changes by the user, thereby potentially increasing administrative overhead for such updates.

**Examples Scenario:**

- A user gets a new email address and wishes to update their primary contact email in the Pathlock system without needing to contact an administrator.
- An organization decides to change the format of their email addresses and requires users to update their email addresses accordingly in the Pathlock platform.

**Related Settings:** 

- AllowEditProfile
- EmailVerificationRequired

**Best Practices:** 

- Configure to `True` in environments where users frequently change their email addresses to reduce administrative overhead.
- Avoid when strict control over email addresses is required for security or communication integrity. In such cases, keep this setting `False` and manage email updates through an administrative process.
