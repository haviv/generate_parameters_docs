# Custom Authentication Provider Additional Parameter

**Technical Name:** CustomAuthenticationProviderAdditionalParameter

**Category:** Security

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

This parameter specifies additional configurations for custom authentication providers in the Pathlock cloud GRC platform. It allows for the extension or modification of authentication behavior, enabling the use of non-standard or third-party authentication mechanisms.

**Business Impact:**

Proper configuration ensures that only authorized users have access to sensitive compliance, risk, and security management functions, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential compliance violations.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When correctly configured, it enhances the security of the Pathlock GRC platform by enabling more sophisticated authentication schemes, including integration with external systems. This ensures that authentication processes are aligned with organizational security policies and external compliance requirements.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Enhancing Security:** A financial institution uses a proprietary two-factor authentication system for all internal applications. By configuring this parameter, they integrate this system with the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform, ensuring consistent security practices across all tools.
  
- **Regulatory Compliance:** A healthcare organization subject to HIPAA regulations can use this parameter to implement a custom authentication provider that meets specific security standards, thus ensuring compliance with legal requirements.

**Related Settings:**

- `CustomAuthenticationProviderUrl`: Defines the URL for the custom authentication provider, which is critical for routing authentication requests to the correct endpoint.

**Best Practices:** configure when implementing custom or enhanced authentication mechanisms not supported out of the box by Pathlock, avoid when default authentication methods suffice and meet the organization's security requirements.
