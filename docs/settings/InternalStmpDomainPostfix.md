# Internal email address postfix

**Technical Name:** InternalStmpDomainPostfix

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** The parameter `InternalStmpDomainPostfix` configures the domain postfix for internal email addresses, enabling integration with enterprise email systems within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform.

**Business Impact:** Proper configuration ensures seamless communication and notifications between the Pathlock platform and the users, facilitating timely updates on security, risk, and compliance statuses. Misconfiguration may lead to failed email deliveries, impacting the organization's ability to respond to compliance and security alerts promptly.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When set up correctly, this configuration ensures that emails generated by the Pathlock platform are correctly addressed to reach users within the organization's domain, enhancing the effectiveness of automated workflows and notifications.

**Example Scenario:** If an organization's internal email domain is `@company.com`, setting the parameter to this value ensures that all Pathlock-generated emails are correctly formatted to send to `user@company.com`, thereby ensuring that notifications, such as risk alerts or compliance updates, reach their intended recipients.

**Related Settings:** 

- `SapEmployeeIdTrimZero`: Related to user identification settings in SAP connectors.
- `SapEmployeeIdAddZero`: Further relates to how employee IDs are processed in SAP integrations.
- `IncludeEmployeeADUserNameInWorkflowParameters`: Indicates a connectivity and configuration relationship between user data in Active Directory and workflow parameters in Pathlock.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** Setting up Pathlock for the first time or when changing the internal email system domain.
- **Avoid when:** Unnecessary if the organization does not use email notifications or if Pathlock is not utilized for communicating alerts and updates.
