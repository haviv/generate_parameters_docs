# Sap Read Logs Response Timeout In Minutes

**Technical Name:** SapReadLogsResponseTimeoutInMinutes

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter determines the maximum duration, in minutes, the SAP connector will wait for a response when attempting to read system logs from SAP. It ensures timely processing by avoiding indefinite hangs in scenarios where SAP system may take too long to respond.

**Business Impact:**

Setting an appropriate timeout value impacts the efficiency of log retrieval processes, which are crucial for monitoring, auditing, and compliance purposes. A well-configured timeout prevents potential delays in log processing and ensures that system monitoring does not impact overall system performance.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- A too-short timeout might result in failed log retrievals due to premature termination of the request to SAP.
- A too-long timeout could lead to unnecessary waiting times, possibly affecting the performance of the Pathlock GRC platform operations and delaying the availability of audit trails.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Monitoring Workflow Efficiency:** In an organization where real-time monitoring of SAP logs is critical for compliance, setting this parameter to a balanced value ensures that the logs are retrieved efficiently without overburdening the SAP systems.
- **Audit Preparation:** During periods of increased audit activity, adjusting the timeout to a slightly higher value may accommodate the heavier load without disrupting the workflow.

**Related Settings:** 

- The parameter might interact with other SAP connector settings that handle system log processing and retrieval, ensuring that there's a harmonious balance between performance and completeness of data capture.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:**
  - Adjusting to network latency issues.
  - SAP system performance is known to fluctuate.
- **Avoid when:**
  - The default value aligns well with typical SAP system response times observed.
  - There is no evidence of delays or issues in log retrieval processes that might justify an adjustment.
