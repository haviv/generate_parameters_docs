**Technical Name:** RolesSplliterRolesChildRoleSingleRoleFlag

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** None

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `RolesSplliterRolesChildRoleSingleRoleFlag` parameter is used in the configuration of how child roles are named and managed during role provisioning processes in the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This parameter specifically influences the naming convention applied to child roles, based on patterns defined by the organization, to ensure consistency and clarity in role hierarchies.

**Business Impact:**

Proper configuration of this parameter aids in maintaining a clear, understandable role structure within the organization, which is crucial for effective access control and security posture. Misconfiguration may lead to confusion in role assignments, inefficiencies in role management, and potential security risks through improper access provisioning.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, this parameter affects the splitting and appending behavior of new roles derived from existing ones, ensuring child roles follow a consistent naming convention that aligns with organizational standards and policies. It particularly impacts how child roles are generated in naming sequences, ensuring they are recognizable and traceable back to their parent roles.

**Example Scenario:**

Consider a scenario where an organization needs to create child roles for specific departmental functions beneath a generic parent role. By configuring this parameter correctly, child roles can automatically inherit naming conventions that reflect their parent role and specific departmental function, e.g., "ParentRole_Finance", "ParentRole_HR", facilitating easier role management and clarity in access control.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** there is a need for consistent naming conventions and easy manageability of child roles derived from parent roles within the organization's role-based access control structure.
- **Avoid when:** the organization does not utilize a hierarchical or pattern-based naming convention for roles, or when such granularity in role management is not necessary.
