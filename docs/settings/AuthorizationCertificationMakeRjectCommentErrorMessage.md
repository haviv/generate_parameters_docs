**Technical Name:** AuthorizationCertificationMakeRjectCommentErrorMessage

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** None given

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:** This parameter controls the error message displayed when a mandatory reject comment is not provided during the authorization certification process.

**Business Impact:** Ensuring that mandatory rejection comments are provided during the authorization certification process helps in maintaining a clear audit trail and understanding the context behind access denials. This is crucial for compliance and governance, as it aids in identifying and addressing potential security risks associated with access rights.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When configured, this parameter mandates that users provide a justification comment when rejecting an authorization request in the certification process. It helps enhance security and compliance by ensuring that every reject action is accompanied by a reason, improving the accountability and traceability of decision-making in access management.

**Example Scenario:** A compliance officer is conducting an authorization certification review and decides to reject a userâ€™s access to a sensitive financial report. Since the `AuthorizationCertificationMakeRjectCommentErrorMessage` setting is configured, the system prompts the officer to provide a reason for the rejection, ensuring that all denied access requests are well-documented.
