**Technical Name:** AddCharsToLastPatternSetField

**Category:** User Management

**Default Value:** N/A

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter dynamically adds characters to the last set of a username pattern in the user creation process to ensure uniqueness across systems. It is part of the user creation service, adjusting the username based on predefined patterns and existing usernames within targeted systems.

**Business Impact:**

Ensuring username uniqueness is critical for maintaining secure and effective user management and access control within the organization. Duplicate usernames can lead to access control issues, potential security vulnerabilities, and administrative overhead. This parameter aids in compliance with best practices for identity management.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, this parameter automatically modifies the username generation process by appending additional characters to the last pattern of the username. It interacts with the existing username patterns and the current system's user name length requirement to generate a unique identifier for new users.

**Examples Scenario:**

In a scenario where the system is creating a user with a username that already exists, this parameter would come into action. Suppose the original pattern generates a username like "john.smith". If "john.smith" is already taken, and the policy specifies adding two characters, the system might generate "john.smithe2" or "john.smith12", depending on the configuration and available characters.

- UserNamePattern
- UserNameLength

**Best Practices:** configure when user uniqueness is a concern in environments with a high number of users across multiple systems. Avoid excessive use when simple username patterns are sufficient and uniqueness can be easily achieved without additional characters.
