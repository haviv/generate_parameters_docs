# Show Role Catalog Attribute9

**Technical Name:** ShowRoleCatalogAttribute9

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** False

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `ShowRoleCatalogAttribute9` parameter controls the visibility of certain attributes within the role catalog in the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. When enabled, it reveals the specific attribute associated with roles, enhancing the detail level within the role catalog. 

**Business Impact:**

Enabling this parameter allows security administrators and GRC professionals to gain deeper insights into the roles within their organization, facilitating better governance, risk management, and compliance activities by providing additional data points for analysis and decision-making.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Once configured to `True`, the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform will display the ninth attribute associated with roles in the role catalog. This enrichment of information can help in detailed role analysis, security review, and compliance audit processes by providing an extra layer of data visibility.

**Examples Scenario:**

For an organization aiming to refine its user access review process, turning on the `ShowRoleCatalogAttribute9` could provide auditors and reviewers with enhanced visibility into role attributes that are critical for making informed decisions about user access rights and permissions.

**Related Settings:**

- `ShowRoleCatalogAttribute8`

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** Detailed role analysis is required for security reviews, compliance audits, or to enhance the understanding of role configurations and permissions within the GRC platform.
- **Avoid when:** Minimal role attribute visibility is sufficient for organizational needs, or there is a risk of information overload that could complicate role governance processes.
