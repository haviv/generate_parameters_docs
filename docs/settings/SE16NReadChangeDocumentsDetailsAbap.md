**Description:**

This parameter controls the ability to read detailed change document information within the SAP environment, specifically targeting the SE16N transaction code. It aims at limiting or allowing the extraction of sensitive change document data such as Material Document, Transaction Code, G/L Account Number, Entry date, Time of Entry, and User Name.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling this parameter allows for a comprehensive audit trail regarding changes made within the SAP system, enhancing transparency and accountability. It aids in identifying potentially unauthorized or erroneous changes, thus mitigating risks associated with internal fraud, data integrity issues, or non-compliance with regulatory standards.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- When enabled, it provides auditors and compliance teams with detailed insights into changes, facilitating effective audits and compliance checks.
- Increases the load on system resources due to the detailed tracking of changes.
- May impact user privacy if personal data are included in the change documents.

**Examples Scenario:**

- An auditor wishes to review any changes made to the G/L account numbers within a specific timeframe to ensure all adjustments are authorized and correctly reflected.
- A compliance officer needs to verify that all material document entries made in the last quarter were by authorized personnel to adhere to internal control policies.
