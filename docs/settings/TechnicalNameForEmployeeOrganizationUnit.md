**Category:** User Management

**Default Value:** None

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:** This parameter defines the organizational unit (OU) to which an employee is assigned within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It plays a crucial role in determining the accessibility, compliance, and security policies applied to the user.

**Business Impact:** Proper configuration of the TechnicalNameForEmployeeOrganizationUnit ensures that users have access to appropriate resources and operations within their designated organizational units. This alignment is critical for maintaining operational efficiency, compliance with internal and external regulations, and safeguarding sensitive information.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When configured correctly, the TechnicalNameForEmployeeOrganizationUnit parameter helps in streamlining user management processes. It aids in automating workflows such as adding a user to an organizational unit, changing a user's organizational unit, and assigning specific positions to users. It guarantees that users receive permissions and access in accordance with their job responsibilities and organizational policies.

**Examples Scenario:** If a user is moved from the Finance department to the HR department, updating the TechnicalNameForEmployeeOrganizationUnit parameter will automatically adjust the user's access rights to reflect their new position, ensuring they have access to HR resources while revoking unnecessary Finance permissions.

**Related Settings:** None 

**Best Practices:** configure when a user is onboarded, transferred, or their role within the organization changes to ensure their access rights are aligned with their current position. Avoid when the organizational structure is unclear or in flux, to prevent incorrect access rights assignments.
