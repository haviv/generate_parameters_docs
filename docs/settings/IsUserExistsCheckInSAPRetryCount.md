# Is User Exists Check In SAP Retry Count

**Technical Name:** IsUserExistsCheckInSAPRetryCount

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter controls the number of retry attempts for checking if a user exists in the SAP environment. It is used in scenarios where transient network issues or SAP system performance might initially prevent a successful user existence check. The parameter ensures the system attempts the check multiple times before finalizing the result, enhancing reliability in user verification processes.

**Business Impact:**

Ensuring accurate and reliable user existence checks is crucial for maintaining system security and compliance. Incorrect handling of these checks might lead to unauthorized access or failure to identify valid users, affecting both security posture and operational efficiency. Proper configuration of this retry count helps mitigate these risks by adapting to variable network conditions and system performance.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, this parameter affects the resilience of the system's user existence verification feature, particularly in environments with SAP Central User Administration (CUA) or where direct checks are occasionally skipped as specified in CommonSettings. This leads to reduced false negatives in user verification, ensuring more stable integration with SAP systems and more reliable compliance and security operations.

**Examples Scenario:**

- In an environment with intermittent network issues or high latency to the SAP backend, increasing the `IsUserExistsCheckInSAPRetryCount` can improve the success rate of user existence verification attempts, reducing the impact of network instability on security and compliance checks.

**Related Settings:** 

- `IsCuaEnabled()`
- `CommonSettings.Default.SkipIsUserExistsCheckInSAP`

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** You are experiencing intermittent failures in user existence checks due to network instability or SAP system performance issues. Adjusting the retry count can help accommodate these issues.
- **Avoid when:** Your environment has stable network conditions and SAP system performance where the default retry mechanism suffices for reliable user existence verification. Increasing the retry count unnecessarily might lead to undue processing delay.
