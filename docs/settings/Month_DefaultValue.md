# Month Default Value

**Technical Name:** Month_DefaultValue

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** 2000-01-01

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `Month_DefaultValue` parameter specifies the default start date value used in various features within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform, including reporting filters and initial system setup processes. It pre-sets the starting point for periodical analysis and data initialization activities.

**Business Impact:**

Setting an appropriate default month value is critical for accurate reporting and analysis. It impacts how historical data is interpreted and ensures that compliance, risk analysis, and audit reporting are based upon a consistent and relevant temporal baseline. Incorrect configurations might lead to misleading results, affecting decision-making and compliance status.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Configuring this parameter directly influences the initialization of the date settings across the platform, including automated activity selections, approval processes, and user activity recognition. A well-chosen default value ensures that the system's time-sensitive operations are aligned with the organization's fiscal or operational year, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of generated reports and analyses.

**Examples Scenario:**

A financial audit requires reviewing transactions and user activities for the previous fiscal year starting from January 1st. By setting `Month_DefaultValue` to "2023-01-01", the system will automatically align the reporting period to start from this date, ensuring that the audit covers the correct timeframe without manual adjustments.

- InitializeDate
- EnableAutomaticActivitySelection
- EnableAutomaticApproval

**Best Practices:** configure when initiating the system setup to align with the fiscal year or specific audit period requirements; avoid when there exists a need for dynamic date ranges that do not align with a fixed month start date.
