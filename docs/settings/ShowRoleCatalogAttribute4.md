# Show Role Catalog Attribute4

**Technical Name:** ShowRoleCatalogAttribute4

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The "Show Role Catalog Attribute4" parameter controls the visibility of a specific attribute within the Role Catalog interface of the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This setting allows for the customization of the displayed information to align with organizational needs and preferences regarding role management and visibility.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling this attribute can enhance the understanding of role definitions and assignments by providing additional context or categorization relevant to the organization's operational or compliance requirements. It aids in better governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) processes by ensuring that stakeholders have access to necessary information.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When enabled, this parameter causes the system to display the fourth attribute field for roles in the Role Catalog. This may impact the user interface by adding more information to the display, potentially affecting loading times or screen layout.

**Examples Scenario:**

- An organization requires the visibility of custom attributes such as "Department Code" or "Security Level" within their Role Catalog for better role distinction and mapping. By enabling Show Role Catalog Attribute4, these details are made visible to administrators or auditors, facilitating better decisions regarding role assignments and security policies.

**Related Settings:**

- ShowRoleCatalogAttribute3

**Best Practices:** 

- Configure when additional information about roles is necessary for governance, risk, and compliance activities, or to fulfill business needs.
  
- Avoid when simplicity of the role catalog interface is a priority or when additional information does not add value to the role management process.
