# Excel Matrix Freeze Pane Column

**Technical Name:** ExcelMatrix_FreezePaneColumn

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `ExcelMatrix_FreezePaneColumn` parameter is designed to specify the column at which a freeze pane is applied in Excel spreadsheets generated by the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This setting allows for improved readability and navigation of complex datasets by keeping the specified column static while scrolling through the document.

**Business Impact:**

Configuring this parameter enhances the usability of Excel reports, especially for end-users analyzing critical security, risk, and compliance data. It ensures that key information remains visible, facilitating better decision-making and enabling a more efficient audit and review processes.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Once set, this parameter determines the vertical division in the spreadsheet. Everything to the left of this column will remain frozen or static, and everything to the right will scroll horizontally. This is particularly useful for reports with a large number of columns, where key identifier columns such as user IDs, risk identifiers, or compliance status indicators need to remain in view for context.

**Examples Scenario:**

For instance, if the `ExcelMatrix_FreezePaneColumn` is set to "4", in any generated Excel report, the first three columns A, B, and C will remain visible when a user scrolls horizontally through the spreadsheet. This could be critical when viewing long lists of access permissions, where the user's name and department might be in the first few columns and need to remain in view to make sense of the permissions listed in the subsequent columns.

**Best Practices:** configure when reports are expected to have a significant number of columns, making horizontal navigation challenging without a freeze pane. Avoid when reports are simple, with only a few key columns, where a freeze pane would not significantly enhance user navigation or readability.
