# Query Designer Top Records For Timeout Scenario

**Technical Name:** QueryDesginerTopRecordsForTimeoutScenario

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:** 120

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** This setting determines the maximum amount of time, in seconds, the Query Designer will wait for a query to complete before timing out when exporting to Excel. This helps in avoiding long-running queries that can impact system performance and user experience.

**Business Impact:** Proper configuration of this parameter ensures that reports generated by the Query Designer are produced in a timely manner, preventing delays in accessing critical compliance, risk, and security reports. It balances between the need for complete data retrieval and system performance.

**Technical Impact when configured:** Setting an optimal timeout value helps in managing the system load effectively. A too low value might lead to incomplete report generation, whereas a too high value could allow potentially costly operations to run longer than necessary, impacting system resources and other users' experiences.

**Examples Scenario:** Consider a scenario where compliance officers need to export a large dataset from the Query Designer to Excel for audit purposes. If the query to retrieve this data takes longer than expected, the operation might timeout, leading to incomplete data export. Adjusting the `QueryDesginerTopRecordsForTimeoutScenario` parameter allows the organization to find a balance between performance and completeness of the data exported.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** There is a need to handle large datasets being exported to Excel, especially in environments where the data volume and complexity can lead to long retrieval times.
  
- **Avoid when:** Default timeout settings adequately support the majority of the reporting operations without causing performance issues or reporting delays.
