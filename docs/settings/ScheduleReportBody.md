# Schedule Report Body

**Technical Name:** ScheduleReportBody

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:** Not Applicable

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

This parameter is designed to configure the body content of scheduled reports within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It allows the customization of report content tailored to specific organizational needs, focusing on security, risk, and compliance data for SAP environments.

**Business Impact:**

Configuring the ScheduleReportBody correctly ensures that stakeholders receive comprehensive and relevant data related to the organization's security posture, compliance status, and risk assessments. This, in turn, supports informed decision-making and enhances the organization's ability to respond to vulnerabilities, compliance requirements, and risk.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When properly set up, the ScheduleReportBody enriches scheduled reports with detailed and relevant information customized to the recipient's role and responsibilities. This leads to improved awareness and understanding of the GRC landscape, facilitates compliance with internal and external audit requirements, and aids in identifying and mitigating risks in a timely manner.

**Example Scenario:**

A financial institution needs to provide monthly compliance reports to regulatory bodies, demonstrating adherence to financial security regulations. By configuring the ScheduleReportBody, the institution can automate the inclusion of specific compliance metrics, user access reviews, and risk assessments relevant to financial regulations, thus streamlining the reporting process and ensuring regulatory compliance.

**Best Practices:**

- **Avoid when:** The default reporting templates meet your organization's needs or if report customization could lead to information overload for the recipients.
