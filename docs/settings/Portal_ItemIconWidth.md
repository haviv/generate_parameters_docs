# Portal - Icon width

**Technical Name:** Portal_ItemIconWidth

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `Portal_ItemIconWidth` parameter determines the width of icons within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform's user interface. Adjusting this setting affects how icon-based elements are displayed and can influence the user interface's overall usability and aesthetic.

**Business Impact:**

Proper configuration of the icon width is crucial for ensuring that the portal's user interface is visually appealing and efficiently utilizes space. This can impact the end-user experience by enhancing navigation and making the interface more intuitive and accessible.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- **Usability Enhancement:** Setting an appropriate icon width can improve how information is presented, making it easier for users to recognize and interact with various UI elements.
- **Visual Harmony:** Ensures consistency in the visual layout, contributing to a cleaner and more professional appearance of the portal.
- **Optimized Space Usage:** Helps in managing the screen real estate more efficiently, especially in sections of the portal where space is a premium.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Improving Dashboard Usability:** If users report that icons on their dashboard are too large and cluttering the view, reducing the `Portal_ItemIconWidth` can declutter the interface, making it easier to navigate.
- **Enhanced Readability:** In cases where icons overshadow text descriptions next to them, adjusting their width can balance the text-icon ratio, improving the overall readability of the portal.
