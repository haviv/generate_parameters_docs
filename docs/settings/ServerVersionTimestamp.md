**Description:** The Server Version Timestamp parameter is used to track the version updates of the Pathlock GRC platform software. It keeps a record of when the software version was last updated, ensuring that the system's security, risk, and compliance capabilities are up-to-date.

**Business Impact:** Accurate tracking and management of the software version timestamp directly impact the organization's ability to maintain a secure, risk-compliant environment. It helps in ensuring that the system is protected against vulnerabilities by keeping the software updated.

**Technical Impact when configured:** Proper configuration of the Server Version Timestamp ensures that all software updates, upgrades, and patches are documented. This aids in auditing, troubleshooting, and analyzing the system's history over time to ensure compliance and operational integrity.

**Example Scenario:** For instance, after a major software update to address specific compliance requirements or to enhance security features, the Server Version Timestamp will record the date and time of this update. This timestamp can then be referenced in compliance audits to verify that the system was updated in accordance with the relevant security standards.
