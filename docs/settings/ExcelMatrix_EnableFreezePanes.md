# Excel Matrix Enable Freeze Panes

**Technical Name:** ExcelMatrix_EnableFreezePanes

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:** True

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** Determines whether to freeze panes in the generated Excel matrix reports, enhancing the usability for end users by keeping headers visible when scrolling.

**Business Impact:** Improves report readability and user experience by allowing users to easily navigate and analyze large sets of GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) data without losing context of the column or row headers.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When enabled, this setting freezes the first row and/or column (depending on the report layout) in Excel reports generated by the system, ensuring that headers remain visible as the user scrolls through the data. This is particularly useful for reports with a large amount of data, improving the ease of data analysis and review.

**Example Scenario:** A compliance officer generates a report to review user access levels across various systems. The report includes multiple columns for system names, user IDs, and access levels. With ExcelMatrix_EnableFreezePanes set to `True`, the system names and header row remain visible as the officer scrolls down the list, facilitating easier cross-referencing and analysis without needing to scroll up repeatedly to remember which column represents which data point.

**Related Settings:**
- EnableSM20DetailedLogFromSE16 (although related in the codebase as a setting, it serves a different functional purpose)

**Best Practices:** 
- **Configure when** generating Excel reports that contain large sets of data where keeping headers in view at all times aids in data readability and analysis.
- **Avoid when** generating smaller reports where freezing panes is unnecessary and may restrict the viewable area of the report on smaller screens.
