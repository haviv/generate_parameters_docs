This parameter ensures that systems and users are able to correctly associate activities with their corresponding entity names, aiding in the management of security, risk, and compliance.

**Business Impact:**

Correct configuration of this parameter influences the effectiveness of activity tracking, risk assessments, and the enforcement of compliance policies. It ensures that activities are properly categorized and managed, facilitating easier audit processes, improved security posture, and better compliance management.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When `MainEntityNameForActivity` is configured, the system can accurately associate activities with the correct entity names, enhancing data integrity and reliability. This configuration aids in precise activity tracking, compliance verification, and risk management processes by ensuring that entities are correctly identified and associated with their activities.

**Example Scenario:**

A financial institution uses the `MainEntityNameForActivity` parameter to distinguish between different types of sensitive transactions.

Avoid when:
- Insufficient information about entity-activity relationships exists, leading to potential misconfigurations that could impair data tracking and integrity.
