**Impact Level:** Low

**Description:** This parameter configures the minimum tint value for background colors in the job roles sheet during the import process.

**Business Impact:** Adjusting this value ensures that the job roles sheet is visually consistent and adheres to the organizational branding guidelines. It enhances readability and clarity, which is essential for accurate job role interpretation and assignment.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When set, this parameter adjusts the minimum threshold for background color brightness, impacting the appearance of imported job role sheets. This can affect the ease of distinguishing different job roles based on background color coding.

**Examples Scenario:** If an organization decides that job roles related to security need to stand out with a lighter background for easy identification, configuring this parameter ensures that any background color assigned to security roles does not fall below the specified brightness level. This helps in quick visual identification of security-related roles in large and complex sheets.
