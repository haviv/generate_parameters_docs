**Description:**

The `MicrosoftGraphSendMail` parameter is part of the Pathlock GRC platform, specifically within the email notification and communication system. It utilizes Microsoft Graph API to send emails directly from the platform, enabling seamless and automated communication workflows.

**Business Impact:**

Configuring the `MicrosoftGraphSendMail` parameter correctly will ensure timely and efficient communication with stakeholders and system users. This could range from sending automated risk notifications, compliance reports, or workflow reminders, directly impacting the organization's ability to manage security, risks, and compliance efficiently.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Upon successful configuration, the system will authenticate with Microsoft Graph using OAuth tokens to send emails. This automation facilitates prompt delivery of system-generated notifications and reports, reducing manual effort and minimizing the risk of human error or oversight.

**Example Scenario:**

A company uses the Pathlock GRC platform to manage its compliance with GDPR. They configure the `MicrosoftGraphSendMail` parameter to automate emails to their GDPR compliance team whenever a potential violation is detected. This prompt action allows the team to address and mitigate risks swiftly, ensuring ongoing compliance with regulations.
