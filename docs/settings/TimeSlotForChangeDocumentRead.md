# Time Slot For Change Document Read

**Technical Name:** TimeSlotForChangeDocumentRead

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `TimeSlotForChangeDocumentRead` parameter is designed to define the time frame for which change documents are read from the system. It specifies the start (fromDate) and end (toDate) datetime parameters to narrow down the selection of change documents, facilitating focused and efficient data processing within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform.

**Business Impact:**

Setting an appropriate time slot for reading change documents enables organizations to efficiently manage and audit changes within their IT environment. By focusing on specific time frames, businesses can streamline their review processes, enhance security monitoring, and effectively comply with regulatory requirements by ensuring that all relevant changes are accounted for and audited.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, this parameter optimizes the system's performance by limiting the data set to a manageable range. This targeted approach reduces the load on the system, leading to faster processing times and minimizing the risk of missing critical change documents during audits and compliance checks.

**Examples Scenario:**

A company wants to audit changes made in the SAP environment during the end-of-month financial close process. By setting the `TimeSlotForChangeDocumentRead` parameter to cover this period, the system will only fetch change documents relevant to this timeframe, making the audit process more manageable and focused.

**Related Settings:**

- `MainEntityNameForActivity`
- `UseValidityDateAsDeleted`

**Best Practices:** configure when,

- There is a need to perform focused audits on changes over specific periods.
- Performance issues arise due to an extensive dataset of change documents.

avoid when,

- Continuous, real-time monitoring of changes is required across the entire system with no specific focus on time frames.
