**Departments Level Skip Items**

**Technical Name:** DepartmentsLevelSkipItems

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** None

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** Determines which organizational levels should be skipped during the processing of departmental data within the Pathlock GRC platform.

**Business Impact:** Allows for flexibility in structuring the organization's GRC hierarchy by skipping specified department levels, which can streamline the management and reporting of security, compliance, and risk metrics.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When configured, the system will exclude certain department levels from consideration in the organizational structure, potentially affecting how permissions, roles, and responsibilities are mapped and enforced.

**Example Scenario:** If your organization does not require granular reporting or management at specific departmental levels (e.g., sub-departments within a larger department that do not handle sensitive information or perform critical functions), configuring this parameter to skip those levels can reduce complexity without compromising on security or oversight.

**Best Practices:** Configure when there is a clear understanding of the organizational structure and certain levels do not require direct oversight within the GRC process. Avoid when every departmental level is crucial for detailed GRC reporting and compliance checks.
