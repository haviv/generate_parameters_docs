**Description:**

The `Portal_ItemIconHeight` parameter controls the height of icons within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform, specifically on the portal interface. This setting allows customization of the visual presentation of icons, ensuring that they align well with the overall design and are visually accessible to users.

**Business Impact:**

Adjusting the icon height can directly influence user experience and interface aesthetics. Properly sized icons enhance the user's ability to navigate and understand the portal intuitively, leading to improved efficiency and satisfaction.

**Examples Scenario:**

A company wants to redesign its GRC portal to make it more user-friendly. They have received feedback that the current icons are too small and difficult for users to accurately click on, especially on mobile devices. The company decides to adjust the `Portal_ItemIconHeight` parameter to increase the icons' height, thereby improving user interaction on various devices.
