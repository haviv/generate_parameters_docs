# Smart Query Text Box Width

**Technical Name:** SmartQueryTextBoxWidth

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** The default pixel width value is determined by the `CommonSettings` in the Pathlock GRC platform configuration.

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** The Smart Query Text Box Width parameter controls the width of text input fields within the Smart Query feature of the Pathlock GRC platform. It allows for the adjustment of text box dimensions to accommodate different data entry needs.

**Business Impact:** Proper configuration of the Smart Query Text Box Width impacts the user interface by ensuring that query inputs are visually accessible and appropriately sized for the data being entered. This can enhance user experience, reduce data entry errors, and improve the efficiency of query management processes.

**Technical Impact when configured:** Adjusting the Smart Query Text Box Width can affect how users interact with query forms by altering the visibility and accessibility of information. A width that is too narrow may hinder the ability to review the full text of a query, while a width that is too broad may unnecessarily expand the UI element, potentially affecting the layout of the web page.

**Examples Scenario:** 
- **Adjusting for Readability:** If users report that longer query strings are hard to review because the text box does not display the full query, increasing the Smart Query Text Box Width can improve usability.
- **UI Consistency:** To maintain a consistent look and feel across various forms within the Pathlock GRC platform, adjustments to the Smart Query Text Box Width may be necessary when custom fields or changes in UI design are implemented.

**Related Settings:** 
- `IsMultipleLines`: Enabling this setting impacts how the Smart Query Text Box Width is utilized, allowing for multi-line input which may require wider text boxes.
- `IsWaterMarkEnabled`: While not directly impacting width, this setting affects the user interface and may be considered when configuring text box properties.

**Best Practices:** 
- **Configure when:** User feedback indicates issues with data visibility or when UI design updates necessitate adjustments to the field sizes.
- **Avoid when:** Default settings adequately accommodate the data input needs, and no user experience issues have been reported.
