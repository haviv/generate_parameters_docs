**Description:** This parameter is used to specify the type ID for user group categorization within the Pathlock GRC platform. It allows for the classification of user groups under various categories, facilitating better management and organization.

**Business Impact:** Proper configuration of the UserCategories_UserGroupTypeId parameter can lead to more efficient user group management, enabling administrators to apply specific policies and controls to distinct categories. This segmentation can aid in compliance, security posture, and streamlined user access processes.

**Technical Impact when configured:** Once configured, this parameter impacts how user groups are categorized and managed within the system. It may affect the application of security controls, reporting capabilities, and how users are granted access to various resources based on their group's categorization.

**Examples Scenario:** An organization may define multiple user categories such as 'Administration', 'Finance', 'IT', and 'HR'. By assigning a UserGroupTypeId to each category, the organization can easily apply specific access controls, review compliance requirements, and generate reports based on these distinct categories.
