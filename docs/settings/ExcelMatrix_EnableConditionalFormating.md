**Technical Name:** ExcelMatrix_EnableConditionalFormating

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:** Not specified

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** This parameter enables conditional formatting in Excel matrix reports within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. When activated, it applies visual enhancements to the Excel reports based on predefined conditions, making it easier to analyze and interpret risk and compliance data.

**Business Impact:** Enabling conditional formatting in Excel reports significantly improves the readability and immediate understanding of critical data points, such as risk levels, compliance statuses, and audit results. It helps stakeholders quickly identify areas of concern or interest, facilitating faster decision-making and prioritization of actions.

**Technical Impact when configured:** Upon configuration, Excel reports generated by the system will include visual cues such as color coding, font styles, or highlightings that correspond to specific data thresholds or categories. This feature is particularly useful in reports with large datasets, where such conditional formatting can direct attention to anomalies, trends, or exceptions that warrant further investigation or immediate action.

**Examples Scenario:** An organization generates a monthly compliance report to review the status of internal controls across different departments. By enabling conditional formatting, the report automatically highlights any department with compliance scores below a certain threshold in red, drawing immediate attention to areas requiring urgent remediation.

**Best Practices:** Configure when you need to enhance report readability and facilitate the quick identification of key data points. Avoid when dealing with simple data sets where conditional formatting may not significantly impact data comprehension or when the graphical representation could distract from the primary data insights.
