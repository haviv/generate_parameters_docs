# Allow Edit Workflow Form Role

**Technical Name:** AllowEditWorkflowFormRole

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** This parameter controls the ability to edit roles within workflow forms. It is designed to provide administrators the flexibility to manage who can modify roles assigned to specific organizational objects within workflow processes.

**Business Impact:** Adjusting this parameter affects how organizational roles are managed and updated throughout the workflow. By fine-tuning access to edit roles, organizations can ensure appropriate levels of oversight and control over role assignment, significantly impacting compliance and operational efficiency.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When enabled, specific users will be able to edit roles directly from the workflow form, streamlining the process of role management and assignment. This can reduce administrative overhead and improve response times for role-related changes within workflows.

**Examples Scenario:** A company wants to delegate responsibility for updating user roles within certain workflows to department heads instead of burdening the IT department with these tasks. By enabling this parameter, department heads can directly edit roles within the workflow form, allowing for quicker updates and reducing bottlenecks.

**Best Practices:** 

- Configure when: You aim to decentralize role management and empower specific users or departments with the ability to update roles within their workflows.
  
- Avoid when: There is a need for strict control over role management by a centralized team (such as IT or security) to ensure compliance and avoid unauthorized changes.
