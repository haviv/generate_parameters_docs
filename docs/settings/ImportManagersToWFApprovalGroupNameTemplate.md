# Import Managers To Workflow Approval Group Name Template

**Technical Name:** ImportManagersToWFApprovalGroupNameTemplate

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter configures the naming template for groups responsible for workflow approvals within the Pathlock GRC platform. Specifically, it tailors the grouping of managers imported into workflow approval processes, facilitating streamlined management and oversight of approval workflows.

**Business Impact:**

Proper configuration ensures that workflow approval processes are aligned with organizational structures and hierarchy, promoting efficient and accurate review cycles. Misconfiguration could lead to delays in workflow processing and potential bottlenecks in approval channels, directly impacting the speed and reliability of business decision-making processes related to security, risk management, and compliance.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When properly configured, this parameter dynamically structures workflow approval groups based on the organization's unique managerial hierarchy, ensuring that the right managers receive the appropriate workflow tasks for approval. It enables automatic assignment and updates of workflow tasks to appropriate managers, reducing manual overhead and the risk of errors.

**Examples Scenario:**

For instance, if an organization wishes to have a separate approval group for each department, the template could be set to "[DepartmentName] Managers", which would automatically group managers into approval groups named after their respective departments, like "HR Managers" or "IT Managers". This ensures that only relevant managers are tasked with approvals, streamlining the process and enhancing security by enforcing the principle of least privilege.

**Related Settings:**

- `CheckSodForEmployeesWithMultiSystemAccess`: This setting, by ensuring checks against segregation of duties (SOD) for employees with access to multiple systems, complements the Import Managers To Workflow Approval Group Name Template by reinforcing security and compliance in the workflow approval process.

**Best Practices:** configure when the organization has a clear hierarchical management structure that can be mirrored in the workflow approval process. Avoid when the organizational structure is flat or when managers do not play a role in the workflow approval process.
