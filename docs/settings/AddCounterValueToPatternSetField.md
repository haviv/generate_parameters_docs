# Add Counter Value To Pattern Set Field

**Technical Name:** AddCounterValueToPatternSetField

**Category:** User Management

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `AddCounterValueToPatternSetField` parameter is used to dynamically adjust username creation patterns by integrating a counter value. This facilitates unique username generation, particularly in environments where username collisions may occur.

**Business Impact:**

Ensuring unique username creation is paramount in managing user identities effectively within an organization. This parameter helps in avoiding user access issues and potential security risks associated with duplicate usernames.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Upon configuration, this parameter enables the system to append a numerical counter to usernames that match a specific pattern set, thus ensuring the uniqueness of every username generated. This is especially useful in large organizations or systems where the volume of users is high and the possibility of username duplication is more likely.

**Examples Scenario:**

Suppose an organization needs to create usernames for new users based on their first and last names. However, common names might lead to username duplication. By enabling the `AddCounterValueToPatternSetField`, usernames for subsequent users with the same name can have an incremented value, like JohnDoe1, JohnDoe2, ensuring each username is unique.

**Related Settings:** N/A

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** Immediate and future-proof user provisioning is essential, especially in large organizations with high user turnover or commonality in names.
- **Avoid when:** The organization has a unique naming convention that inherently avoids duplication, or the volume of users is low enough that manual intervention is feasible for the occasional duplicate.
