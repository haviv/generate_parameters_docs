# Authorization Description

**Technical Name:** AuthorizationDescription

**Category:** Security

**Default Value:** Not set by default

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:** This parameter is used to specify custom descriptions for authorization objects within the Pathlock GRC platform, enabling finer control over how authorizations are granted and described across different roles, profiles, jobs, and applications.

**Business Impact:** Proper configuration of authorization descriptions ensures that security policies are precisely communicated and enforced, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access to sensitive resources. This directly supports compliance efforts and minimizes risks associated with improper access permissions.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When configured, the AuthorizationDescription parameter allows for detailed customization of authorization rules, which can be tailored to specific organizational roles, job functions, or applications. This granularity ensures that access controls are as strict or as lenient as necessary, according to the specific security requirements.

**Examples Scenario:** If an organization needs to implement specific security protocols for users accessing their financial applications, the AuthorizationDescription parameter can be configured to reflect the unique authorization requirements for these roles. For example, "FinanceTeamAccess" might be a defined authorization description that encapsulates a set of rules for viewing, editing, and managing financial reports and data.

- JobFunctionAuthorization

**Best Practices:** 

Configure when:
- Defining new roles or authorizations that require detailed descriptions beyond the scope of generic settings
- Updating security policies that necessitate revisions to existing authorization descriptions
- Implementing granular access controls tied to specific business processes or compliance requirements

Avoid when:
- General access controls are sufficient for the use case, and the overhead of maintaining detailed descriptions outweighs the security benefits
- The organization lacks the resources to accurately maintain and update the authorization descriptions as roles and requirements evolve
