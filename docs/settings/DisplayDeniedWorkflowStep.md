# Display Denied Workflow Step

**Technical Name:** DisplayDeniedWorkflowStep

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** (The code references do not explicitly state a default value; hence, this information is currently unavailable.)

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** This parameter controls the visibility of denied steps within a given workflow process. It dictates whether users can view the steps that were denied during their workflow's execution.

**Business Impact:** Enabling this parameter can enhance transparency and accountability within business processes by allowing users to identify and understand where bottlenecks or denials occurred. This can be critical for compliance, audit trails, and process improvement.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When activated, users will have the visibility of denied steps within workflows, which could potentially influence decision-making processes, user training, and system optimization strategies.

**Examples Scenario:** In a scenario where a userâ€™s request for access rights is denied due to not meeting certain compliance criteria, enabling this parameter would allow the user to see exactly which step of the workflow was not approved, thereby providing clarity and direction for resolving the compliance issue.

**Related Settings:** Unfortunately, the code references provided do not explicitly mention any related settings directly tied to the DisplayDeniedWorkflowStep parameter.

**Best Practices:** 
- **Configure when:** Transparency in the workflow process is needed to identify and address bottlenecks or failure points, which is essential for continuous process improvement and compliance adherence.
- **Avoid when:** The visibility of denied steps may reveal sensitive decision-making criteria or when the organization opts for simplicity over detailed process visibility for the end user.
