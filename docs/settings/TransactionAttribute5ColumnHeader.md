**Description:** This parameter is used to specify the column header for the fifth transaction attribute in reports and user interfaces within the Pathlock GRC platform.

**Business Impact:** Adjusting this parameter can significantly impact how transaction data is presented to users, influencing readability, understanding, and the ease of identifying critical information in reports. Proper configuration ensures that the reports are aligned with organizational terminologies and compliance requirements.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When this parameter is set, it customizes the display of transaction-related reports and screens by modifying the fifth transaction attribute's column header. This adjustment helps in tailoring the application's user interface to better match company-specific data presentation standards.

**Examples Scenario:** If an organization prefers to label transaction attributes in reports with specific business-related terminology, such as "Region Code" for geographic identifiers or "Dept Code" for departmental references, configuring this parameter with the desired term ensures that reports are immediately understandable and relevant to the business users.
