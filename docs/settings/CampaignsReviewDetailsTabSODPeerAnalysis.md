**Category:** SOD (Segregation of Duties)

**Default Value:** Not provided in the code references

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**
The Campaigns Review Details Tab SoD Peer Analysis parameter is used within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to determine the visibility and operational behavior of the Peer Analysis feature within the Segregation of Duties (SoD) review process. It specifically affects how details related to SoD conflicts are displayed and managed in authorization campaign reviews.

**Business Impact:**
Enabling this parameter ensures that during compliance and audit reviews, users can perform in-depth peer analysis within the SoD framework, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of SoD conflicts and their potential impact on security and compliance. It supports robust risk management and enhances the ability to identify, mitigate, and report on security risks related to improper access controls or conflict of interest situations.

**Technical Impact when configured:**
When configured, this parameter activates the Peer Analysis tab in the SoD review sections of role details, allowing for a detailed examination and comparison of roles and their associated SoD conflicts within the organization. This aids in identifying potential security vulnerabilities and ensuring that user roles are aligned with the organization's compliance and security policies.

**Examples Scenario:**
Consider an organization undergoing an internal audit to assess compliance with industry regulations related to access controls and conflict of interest policies. By enabling the Campaigns Review Details Tab SoD Peer Analysis, auditors can easily compare roles and access rights among similar user profiles, identify unauthorized access, and recommend corrective actions to mitigate any identified risks.

**Best Practices:** 
- Configure when: Conducting internal audits, enhancing security policies, or when there is a need to deeply understand access rights and role distributions among users.
- Avoid when: If the organization's current focus is on performance optimization over security detail analysis, as enabling this feature may introduce additional processing overhead.
