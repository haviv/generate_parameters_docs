# Pad Transaction Codes

**Technical Name:** PadTransactionCodes

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** *Not specified*

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `PadTransactionCodes` parameter is utilized within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to ensure smooth handling and management of transaction codes within the system's operational parameters. It filters and manages transaction codes, focusing on actively used (non-deleted) transactions to maintain system integrity and compliance.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling precise control over which transaction codes are available and active within the system, directly affecting the organization's ability to audit, report, and comply with various regulatory requirements. It ensures that only valid, non-deleted transactions are considered in any compliance or security analysis, thus supporting accurate risk management practices.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- Ensures the exclusion of deleted transactions from compliance checks, auditing, and reporting, providing a clean data set for analysis.
- Improves system performance by filtering out irrelevant data, streamlining compliance, and security operations.
- Enhances the accuracy of transaction-related reports and audits by excluding transactions that have been marked as deleted.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Compliance Reporting:** When generating compliance reports, an organization would need to ensure that only active transactions are considered. By configuring `PadTransactionCodes` appropriately, the system will exclude any transactions marked as deleted, thereby ensuring the integrity and relevance of the report data.
  
- **Security Audit:** During a security audit, auditors can accurately assess the transaction history and activities without the clutter of deleted transactions, making the audit process more efficient and the findings more relevant.

**Related Settings:** 

*While there were references to various settings in the code, specific related settings to `PadTransactionCodes` were not directly mentioned. Only include specific related settings if their direct connection to `PadTransactionCodes` is confirmed through the code analysis.*

**Best Practices:** 
- **Configure when:** Setting up or reviewing system configurations for compliance and security reporting. It's crucial to ensure that only relevant transaction data is analyzed and reported.
- **Avoid when:** There is a specific need to include deleted transactions in a broad data analysis or audit scope, which is generally not recommended for standard compliance and security practices.
