**Description:**

The CurrentImageLogoHeight parameter defines the height of the current image logo used within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This configuration affects how logo images are displayed on the user interface, ensuring that they fit properly without affecting the page layout or user experience.

**Business Impact:**

Proper setting of the CurrentImageLogoHeight parameter ensures that the company's branding is accurately represented on the platform. It maintains the professional appearance of the application by ensuring that logos are not distorted or improperly sized, which could potentially harm the organization's image or cause user interface inconsistencies.

Incorrect configuration may result in distorted or improperly displayed logos, negatively impacting the user experience and visual aesthetics of the platform.
