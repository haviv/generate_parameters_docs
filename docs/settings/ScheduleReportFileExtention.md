# Schedule Report File Extension

**Technical Name:** ScheduleReportFileExtention

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:** not provided in the code references

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The Schedule Report File Extension parameter determines the file format for scheduled reports generated by the system. This setting allows for customization of the output format to meet organization-specific document management and compatibility requirements.

**Business Impact:**

Selecting an appropriate file extension for scheduled reports impacts how data is consumed, shared, and archived within the organization. A well-chosen file format ensures compatibility across different platforms and devices, facilitates easy access for stakeholders, and supports compliance with data management policies.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When this parameter is configured, it dictates the format in which all scheduled reports are generated and saved. This can affect the usability of the reports depending on the chosen file extension, as some formats may be more suitable for detailed analysis and others for broader sharing.

**Example Scenario:**

If an organization requires scheduled reports to be easily accessible and editable, setting the Schedule Report File Extension to `.xls` or `.xlsx` would be appropriate, allowing for direct manipulation in spreadsheet applications. Conversely, for static reporting intended for viewing or printing, `.pdf` might be chosen to ensure formatting consistency across platforms.

**Related Settings:** 

Not explicitly mentioned in the provided code references.

**Best Practices:** configure when the organization has a standardized process for report distribution and consumption; avoid when multiple file formats might create confusion or compatibility issues.
