# Transaction Attribute4 Column Header

**Technical Name:** TransactionAttribute4ColumnHeader

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:** N/A

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** The Transaction Attribute4 Column Header parameter is used to define the display name of the fourth transaction attribute in reporting views within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform.

**Business Impact:** Customizing this parameter allows organizations to align the reporting interface with their internal terminology and reporting standards, improving the readability and relevance of transaction reports for audit, compliance, and monitoring purposes.

**Technical Impact when configured:** Once set, this configuration impacts how transaction data is presented in reports, specifically naming the column under which the fourth transaction attribute will be listed, thereby affecting data interpretation and analysis for decision-making processes.

**Examples Scenario:** If an organization wishes to monitor and report on a specific attribute of their transactions, such as 'Project Code' which is not explicitly defined within the standard reporting templates, they can configure this parameter to display 'Project Code'. This customization ensures that reports generated will include a column specifically for 'Project Code', making it easier for users to locate and analyze this data.
