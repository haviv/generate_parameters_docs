# SoD Simulate For License Impact

**Technical Name:** SoDSimulateForLicenseImpact

**Category:** SOD

**Default Value:** 

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:**

The SoDSimulateForLicenseImpact parameter is designed to simulate the impact of Segregation of Duties (SoD) violations on the licensing of new roles and transactions assigned to an employee. It enables organizations to proactively manage and mitigate the risk of unauthorized or conflicting transaction combinations that may arise from new role assignments.

**Business Impact:**

Implementing this parameter helps in maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements by preventing unauthorized access combinations and detecting potential SoD violations before they occur. It significantly reduces the risk of fraud and data breaches, ensuring that the organization's GRC (Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance) posture is maintained.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, the SoDSimulateForLicenseImpact parameter allows the system to analyze and identify potential SoD conflicts that could arise from assigning specific roles to employees, considering both current and new transactions. This proactive analysis aids in making informed decisions on role assignments and transaction permissions, minimizing compliance and security risks.

**Examples Scenario:**

A financial organization is integrating new financial software that requires specific roles and transactions assigned to certain employees. To ensure regulatory compliance and maintain internal controls, the SoDSimulateForLicenseImpact parameter could be configured to simulate and identify any SoD violations that the new roles might introduce, allowing the organization to adjust role assignments accordingly before implementation.

**Best Practices:** configure when introducing new roles or transactions, especially in tightly regulated industries like finance or healthcare, to preemptively identify and mitigate potential SoD violations. Avoid when unnecessary, to reduce processing overhead and complexity in role management.
