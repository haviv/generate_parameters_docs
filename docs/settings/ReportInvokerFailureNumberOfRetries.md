# Report Invoker Failure Number Of Retries

**Technical Name:** ReportInvokerFailureNumberOfRetries

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter controls the number of retry attempts made when a report invocation fails due to the target output file not being generated or found empty. It ensures reports are reliably generated by attempting to rerun the report generation process multiple times, based on the specified retry count.

**Business Impact:**

Setting an appropriate number of retries helps in mitigating the risk of report generation failures, which can have significant impacts on compliance reporting, risk assessments, and decision-making processes within an organization. It ensures critical reports are generated and available for review, even in the face of intermittent system or network issues.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When this parameter is configured, the system attempts to regenerate a report the specified number of times before marking the operation as failed. This can increase system resilience and reduce the manual intervention required for rerunning failed report jobs, thus improving the overall efficiency of report generation workflows.

**Examples Scenario:**

- _Scenario:_ A compliance report generation process fails because the specified output file is not immediately available. The system is configured to retry the operation. With the `ReportInvokerFailureNumberOfRetries` parameter set, the system automatically attempts to regenerate the report, overcoming temporary file system delays or network lag issues, thereby ensuring the report's availability for compliance purposes.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** Reports are critical to business operations, and there is a risk of report generation failure due to system or network instabilities.
  
- **Avoid when:** Report generation failures are rare or when system resources are limited, and multiple retries may impact system performance or other time-sensitive operations.
