**Sap Connector Create User Ignore User Already Exists Error**

**Technical Name:** SapConnectorCreateUserIgnoreUserAlreadyExistsError

**Category:** User Management

**Default Value:** False

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter defines whether the SAP Connector should ignore errors related to user creation when the user already exists in the system. If set to true, the process will continue without throwing an error for existing users.

**Business Impact:**

Setting this parameter can significantly impact user onboarding processes by streamlining the creation of new users in bulk operations. It prevents process interruptions due to errors when users already exist, thus ensuring smoother and faster integration with SAP systems.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured to true, this setting allows existing users to be skipped without error, enabling operations or workflows that involve user creation to proceed uninterrupted. This is particularly useful in scenarios involving synchronization of user databases where some users may already be present in the SAP system.

**Examples Scenario:**

For instance, during a mass user import from an HR system to SAP, if this parameter is set to true, the import process wouldn't stop or fail due to the presence of users who already exist in the SAP system. It allows the process to complete, logging the incidents of pre-existing users without stopping the operation.

**Best Practices:** configure when performing bulk user creation or synchronization tasks where the presence of existing users is expected and should not halt the process. Avoid when strict user creation error checking is required, as it could potentially overlook the creation of duplicate user accounts or settings.
