**Technical Name: TechnicalNameForActivityGroup**

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** None

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter is used to assign a specific technical name to an activity group within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It plays a critical role in the organization and categorization of workflow actions, particularly in the grouping of activities to enhance governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) processes.

**Business Impact:**

Assigning technical names to activity groups facilitates better management of user roles, permissions, and audit trails within an organization. It enables GRC administrators to streamline workflow processes, ensuring that activities are properly classified and organized according to the company's security and compliance standards.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, `TechnicalNameForActivityGroup` allows for the aggregation of related activities under a common identifier, simplifying the execution and monitoring of workflow actions. This organization aids in accurate reporting and analysis, thereby improving the efficiency of GRC operations and reducing the likelihood of errors or oversights in compliance tasks.

**Example Scenario:**

A GRC administrator wants to categorize all activities related to data protection under a single group to streamline audits and compliance checks. By assigning a `TechnicalNameForActivityGroup` such as "DataProtectionActivities," the administrator can easily associate all relevant activities to this group. This simplification aids in quick identification and action on these activities during regular audits, enhancing compliance with data protection regulations.
