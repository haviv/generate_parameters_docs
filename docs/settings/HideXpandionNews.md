# Hide Pathlock News

**Technical Name:** HideXpandionNews

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** 

**Impact Level:** Low

**Description:**

The HideXpandionNews parameter controls the visibility of Pathlock news and updates within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. When enabled, it suppresses the display of news-related content to the users, providing a streamlined interface focused on the core functionalities of risk management, compliance, and security.

**Business Impact:**

The usage of this parameter can influence how users interact with the Pathlock platform by minimizing distractions and focusing on the essential elements of GRC management. Organizations that prefer to direct staff attention towards compliance tasks rather than updates or news may find this feature particularly beneficial.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Upon activation, this setting prevents the automatic display of Pathlock news and updates on the dashboard or any other parts of the application where they typically appear. This may enhance application performance slightly due to reduced data loading requirements.

**Examples Scenario:**

- A company has a policy to maintain a clean and distraction-free working interface for its employees using the Pathlock GRC platform. By activating the HideXpandionNews, they can ensure that the employees are not sidetracked by updates or news, enhancing focus and productivity.
