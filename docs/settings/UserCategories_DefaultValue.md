**Technical Name:** UserCategories_DefaultValue

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** False

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `UserCategories_DefaultValue` parameter is used to set the default categorization for users within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This setting helps in categorizing users based on their risk levels and applying default security measures accordingly.

**Business Impact:**

Correct configuration of this parameter ensures that newly created or unclassified users are assigned a default risk level, which in turn, ensures consistent application of security policies and compliance measures across all users within the organization. Misconfiguration can lead to inadequate risk assessment of users, potentially exposing the organization to unmitigated risks.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, this parameter automatically assigns a default risk category to users. This categorization is critical for initiating the appropriate compliance and security protocols, ensuring that all users are subject to baseline security measures.

**Example Scenario:**

- **Scenario 1:** An organization wants to ensure that all new users have a baseline security level assigned to them until a thorough risk assessment is performed. By setting the `UserCategories_DefaultValue` to a predefined risk category, the organization can automatically apply necessary restrictions and monitoring to these users, mitigating potential security risks from the outset.

**Best Practices:** 

- Configure when: Setting up the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform for the first time or when updating the default risk management policies.
- Avoid when: The organization does not have a predefined set of user risk categories or if it requires all users to undergo a personalized risk assessment upon creation.
