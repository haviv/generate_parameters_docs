**Show Application Column**

**Technical Name:** ShowApplicationColumn

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** Not Provided

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The "Show Application Column" parameter controls the visibility of application-specific columns in various grid views within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This parameter is essential for tailoring the user interface to show or hide application-related information based on the user's needs or the specific context of the data being reviewed.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling this parameter can significantly enhance the user's comprehension of data by providing context-specific application information, which is crucial for decision-making processes. It helps in monitoring and managing access control and authorization certifications more effectively. On the other hand, disabling it streamlines the interface by hiding potentially unnecessary details, beneficial in scenarios where application-specific information is not relevant or could lead to information overload.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- **Enabled**: Reveals additional columns in grid views that display data related to specific applications. This can be valuable for detailed audits, security reviews, or compliance checks where understanding the application context is essential.
- **Disabled**: Hides application-specific columns from grid views, leading to a more streamlined interface. This may be preferable for users or scenarios where application details are not necessary, simplifying data presentation and potentially enhancing usability.

**Example Scenario:**

A security analyst reviewing user roles and permissions across various applications might enable "Show Application Column" to see detailed information about which application each role pertains to. This detail allows for a more nuanced examination and management of access controls.

Conversely, a manager conducting a high-level review of employee certifications might prefer to disable the "Show Application Column" to focus on certification statuses without being overwhelmed by application-specific details.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when**: Detailed application-specific insights are necessary for decision-making or when the context of the data requires distinctions between different applications.
- **Avoid when**: Simplifying the interface for users not requiring detailed application-level information or when focusing on broad trends rather than specifics is preferable.
