# Archiving Database Backup Name

**Technical Name:** ArchivingDatabaseBackupName

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The 'Archiving Database Backup Name' parameter is used to define the name of the backup file generated during the database archiving process. This process involves extracting older or less frequently accessed data from the active database to a separate storage location to optimize the database's performance and efficiency.

**Business Impact:**

Choosing an appropriate name for the database backup can facilitate easier identification, retrieval, and management of archival data. It plays a crucial role in data management strategies, especially in compliance with data retention policies and in scenarios requiring data restoration.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Proper configuration ensures that backups are systematically organized and easily identifiable, aiding in data recovery and historical data analysis. Incorrect or inconsistent naming conventions can lead to confusion, inefficiencies in data retrieval, and potential data loss.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Scenario 1:** A financial institution implementing Pathlock needs to comply with legal requirements for retaining transaction records for a minimum of seven years. The institution uses 'ArchivingDatabaseBackupName' to systematically name their monthly transaction backups, e.g., `Financial_Transactions_Archive_YYYY_MM`, enhancing traceability and compliance auditing.
  
- **Scenario 2:** An e-commerce platform archives order data older than two years to maintain system performance. By configuring 'ArchivingDatabaseBackupName', they ensure that backup files are easily identifiable, e.g., `ECommerce_Orders_Archive_YYYY`, simplifying access for business analysis and reporting.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** initiating the database archiving process. Use a naming convention that includes key identifiers (e.g., project or department name) and timestamps to distinguish the backup purpose and its temporal context.
- **Avoid when:** naming conventions are not established, or there is a risk of overwriting existing backups due to ambiguous or repetitive naming.
