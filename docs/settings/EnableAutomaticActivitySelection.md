**Description:**

This setting controls whether activities within a workflow are selected automatically. When enabled, it streamlines workflow processes by automatically moving the workflow to the next step without manual intervention, assuming conditions for progression are met.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling this parameter can significantly improve efficiency in process flows by reducing manual work and decision-making time for users. It can be particularly impactful in environments where rapid decision-making and process execution are critical to business operations.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, this parameter affects the flow of work by automatically selecting the appropriate next step in a workflow. This can lead to faster completion of tasks and reduced processing times, contributing to overall system and operational efficiency.

**Examples Scenario:**

- In a compliance review process, once a document has been uploaded and initially reviewed, enabling this setting could automatically forward the document to the next review phase without requiring a manual action from the compliance officer.
- During an access review workflow, after an employeeâ€™s manager approves their access request, the system can automatically move the request to the IT security team for final approval, streamlining the approval chain.
