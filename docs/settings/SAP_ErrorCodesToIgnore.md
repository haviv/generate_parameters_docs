# Sap Error Codes To Ignore

**Technical Name:** SAP_ErrorCodesToIgnore

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter allows users to define specific SAP error codes that should be ignored during SAP integration processes. It is used to configure the system to bypass certain error messages that may not be critical for the operation or data integrity of the GRC platform.

**Business Impact:**

Specifying error codes to ignore can streamline SAP integration processes by preventing unnecessary interruptions. This is particularly beneficial in environments where known, non-critical errors frequently occur, allowing the business to focus on critical issues and maintain smooth operational workflows.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When SAP_ErrorCodesToIgnore is configured, the system will exclude the specified error codes from triggering fault responses or stopping processes. This can enhance efficiency and reduce manual intervention requirements for known, benign error messages during data synchronization, reporting, or compliance checks within SAP environments.

**Examples Scenario:**

Consider a scenario where an organization frequently encounters specific SAP error codes during data imports that do not affect the integrity of the data being imported. By configuring the SAP_ErrorCodesToIgnore parameter to include these error codes, the system will ignore these specific errors, enabling uninterrupted import processes and reducing the manual effort required to review and dismiss these known error notifications.
