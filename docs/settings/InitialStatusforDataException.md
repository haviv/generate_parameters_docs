**Technical Name:** InitialStatusforDataException

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `InitialStatusforDataException` parameter is used in the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to set the initial status of data exceptions as they are identified during authorization certification processes and other data monitoring workflows. This setting plays a crucial role in determining how these exceptions are handled and reviewed in the system.

**Business Impact:**

Setting an appropriate initial status for data exceptions directly influences the efficiency and effectiveness of the GRC process, impacting how promptly and accurately risk and compliance issues are addressed. A well-chosen initial status ensures that exceptions are routed to the right team or individual for timely review, supporting compliance requirements and mitigating potential risks.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, the `InitialStatusforDataException` parameter directs the workflow engine of the Pathlock GRC platform to automatically assign a predefined status to newly discovered data exceptions. This affects the flow of tasks and priorities within the system, guiding the subsequent actions required for each exception.

**Examples Scenario:**

If the initial status is set to "Review Needed," any new data exceptions found during the authorization certification process are automatically tagged for review, signaling to the compliance team that immediate action is required. This helps in quickly identifying and mitigating violations of access control policies.

**Best Practices:** Configure the initial status based on the typical urgency and impact of data exceptions in your organization to ensure they are handled appropriately. Avoid setting a default status that could lead to delays in addressing critical exceptions or overloading teams with false positives.
