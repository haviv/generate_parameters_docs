**Technical Name:** TechnicalNameForDeclineText

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** None

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter specifies the text that appears on buttons or options within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to indicate a "decline" action within workflow instances. It is used to customize the user interaction by providing specific terminology tailored to the organization's preferences.

**Business Impact:**

Customizing this text can enhance the clarity of the decision-making process in workflow approvals, ensuring that users understand their actions' significance. It impacts the user experience by aligning the platform's language with the organization's internal communication style, potentially reducing errors and misunderstandings in workflow management.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When this parameter is configured, the default text representing a decline action in workflow processes is replaced with the specified custom text. This modification affects all areas of the platform where a decline decision is presented to the user, contributing to a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Clarifying Decision Making in Financial Approvals:** In a financial context, replacing a generic "Decline" text with "Reject Invoice" can provide clearer instructions for users, reducing the risk of incorrect decisions.
  
- **Handling Access Requests:** For IT governance, changing the text to "Deny Access" can make the approval process more specific and understandable for users involved in granting or denying access to systems or information.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** there is a need to align the platform's terminology with the specific language or terms used within your organization's decision-making processes.
  
- **Avoid when:** the default terminology is already clear and understood by all platform users, or if changes might confuse users due to inconsistency with established organizational language.
