Activating this feature significantly enhances an organization's security posture by providing transparency over who accesses what files and when. It aids in detecting unauthorized access and potential data breaches, contributing to the overall integrity and confidentiality of corporate data. For companies subject to compliance regulations regarding data access and privacy, this parameter is indispensable for maintaining compliance and documenting access patterns.
