**Technical Name:** ContentSecurityHeaderCustomSpecificationEnabled

**Category:** Security

**Default Value:** True

**Impact Level:** High

**Description:** Enables the customization of the Content Security Policy (CSP) HTTP header to enhance web security by specifying which dynamic resources are allowed to load. It controls various resources such as scripts, images, and connect sources to protect against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other web-based attacks.

**Business Impact:** Customizing CSP headers can significantly reduce the risk of XSS and data injection attacks on a web application. It ensures that only approved content sources are allowed, thus protecting the integrity and confidentiality of data within the organization. Implementing stringent CSP policies is crucial for maintaining compliance with security standards and regulations.

**Technical Impact when configured:** By enabling this feature, administrators have granular control over the sources from which various types of content can be loaded. It allows setting policies for `connect-src`, `img-src`, and `script-src` directives among others, to enforce strict security measures on the client side, preventing the loading of malicious content.

**Examples Scenario:** An organization wants to ensure that scripts can only be executed from its own domain and prevent inline scripts from running. By enabling ContentSecurityHeaderCustomSpecificationEnabled and configuring `script-src 'self'`, the organization can enforce this policy, thereby mitigating the risk of malicious scripts executed from unauthorized sources.

**Best Practices:** 
- configure when the organization's web applications need stringent security measures to protect against XSS and other web securities vulnerabilities.
- avoid when the web applications require loading resources from multiple domains, which haven't been fully vetted or are dynamically determined, without properly adjusting the CSP policy to ensure functionality while maintaining security.
