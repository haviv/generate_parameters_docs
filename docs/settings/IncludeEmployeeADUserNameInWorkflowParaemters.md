**Technical Name:** IncludeEmployeeADUserNameInWorkflowParaemters

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** False

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter configures whether the Active Directory (AD) username of an employee is included in workflow parameters for custom workflow actions, particularly in contexts where certification processes are not applicable.

**Business Impact:**

Including the employee AD username in workflow parameters can enhance the transparency, traceability, and accountability within various business processes. It enables more personalized and secure workflows, ensuring that actions such as approvals, certifications, and reviews can be reliably tied back to specific users within the organization. This can be particularly important in audit trails and for compliance purposes.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

Once enabled, this setting allows workflow instances to carry the AD username of involved employees as part of their parameter set. This facilitates tighter integration with other IT systems, enhances security by aligning actions with specific user identities, and allows for more granular reporting and auditing capabilities.

**Example Scenario:**

A company implements a workflow for the approval of access requests. By including the AD username in the workflow parameters, the system can automatically verify the request against the user's existing roles and access levels, ensuring that approvals are granted based on the accurate identification of the requestor.

**Best Practices:** 

- Configure when: Enhanced user-level traceability is required in workflow actions, particularly for compliance and auditing purposes.
  
- Avoid when: There is no explicit need to link workflow actions to specific AD usernames, or when minimalism and privacy are preferred in workflow configurations.
