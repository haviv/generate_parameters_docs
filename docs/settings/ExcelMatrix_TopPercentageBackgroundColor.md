**Technical Name:** ExcelMatrix_TopPercentageBackgroundColor

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:** None specified

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** This parameter is used to set the background color of the top percentage of cells in a specified range within an Excel matrix report generated by the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It enhances the visibility and differentiation of key data points based on their significance.

**Business Impact:** Adjusting the top percentage background color aids users in swiftly identifying high-priority items or outliers in their GRC data reports. This visual cue can significantly expedite decision-making processes and risk assessments, particularly in large datasets where such distinctions might not be immediately apparent.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When configured, this parameter dynamically alters the background color of cells that fall within the top percentile of the specified data range in the Excel report. This can greatly improve report readability and the ability to highlight critical data based on specific thresholds or criteria.

**Example Scenario:** In a risk management report, a user might configure this parameter to highlight the top 10% of risks with the highest impact scores in a distinct color. This visualization assists in immediately drawing attention to the most critical risks that require urgent attention or action.

**Related Settings:** 

- `ExcelMatrix_EnableConditionalFormatting`: Enables or disables conditional formatting in Excel matrix reports. This setting must be enabled for `ExcelMatrix_TopPercentageBackgroundColor` to have an effect.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** You need to highlight critical data points or differentiate levels of impact, urgency, or importance within your report data. Especially useful in reports with large data sets or when presenting to stakeholders for quick data assessment.
  
- **Avoid when:** The use of multiple colors might confuse the report's end users, or in reports where color differentiation does not provide significant additional value or insight.
