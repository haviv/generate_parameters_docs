Configuring this parameter correctly ensures that communications, notifications, and reports are accurately targeted, improving efficiency and compliance with internal and regulatory standards for data handling and employee information management.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When this parameter is configured, it allows the system to augment employee records with additional information that can be crucial for tailored communication strategies, HR processes, or organizational reporting. This extra layer of customization benefits various internal workflows by ensuring that employee data reflects specific business unit characteristics or locations.

**Examples Scenario:**
