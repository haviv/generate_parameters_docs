# Sap HR Custom Org Assigment Field

**Technical Name:** SAP_HR_CustomOrgAssigmentField

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** 

This parameter allows for the customization of the organization assignment fields within SAP HR. It enables the modification or addition of custom fields related to an employee's position, job code, and job title within the organization structure.

**Business Impact:**

Customizing organizational assignment fields can have significant implications on HR and organizational reporting, affecting how employee data is structured, queried, and analyzed. This flexibility allows organizations to tailor the system to better fit their unique structure and reporting needs, potentially improving operational efficiency and compliance reporting.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, the system will replace null values for position code, job code, and job title with custom defined values or structures. This ensures that employee records are complete and accurately reflect their current organizational assignments, facilitating more accurate reporting and analysis.

**Examples Scenario:**

An organization wishes to add a custom field to their SAP HR system to track 'Functional Area' alongside the standard 'Position Code', 'Job Code', and 'Job Title'. This could be useful for a business that wants to categorize employees not just by their job role but also by the functional area they operate in, such as Marketing or R&D. The SAP_HR_CustomOrgAssigmentField parameter would be configured to include this new custom field, ensuring that employee records can capture this extra level of detail.

**Best Practices:** configure when the standard organizational assignment fields are not sufficient for your reporting or operational needs. Avoid when standard SAP HR fields meet organizational requirements to prevent unnecessary system complexity.
