# Write Status File

**Technical Name:** WriteStatusFile

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** Not Provided

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

The `WriteStatusFile` parameter is designed for the monitoring and reporting system within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It indicates whether the system should write status files as part of its health checks and operational monitoring. These files are used for auditing, troubleshooting, and ensuring the integrity and performance of the security, compliance, and risk management processes.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling `WriteStatusFile` improves operational visibility and accountability by allowing system administrators and auditors to review system actions, decisions made by the compliance engine, and any inconsistencies or errors that occur. It facilitates compliance with internal policies and regulatory requirements by ensuring that actions are logged and can be audited.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

- **Enabled:** Generates detailed status files for various system components and actions, which can be used for auditing, monitoring health status, and troubleshooting issues.
- **Disabled:** No status files are generated, which may reduce the ability to audit system operations or troubleshoot issues effectively.

**Example Scenario:**

A financial institution subject to rigorous compliance requirements utilizes Pathlock for its GRC needs. By enabling `WriteStatusFile`, the IT department can keep detailed logs of all system health checks and configurations changes. This capability proves invaluable during an audit when the institution must demonstrate its compliance with regulatory standards by providing a trail of monitored activities and system health over time.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:**
  - Compliance with specific regulatory requirements mandates detailed logging of system health and operational status.
  - There is a need for thorough auditing and accountability within the GRC processes.

- **Avoid when:**
  - The system is low on resources, and additional logging might impact performance.
  - The operational risk associated with not having detailed status logs is deemed low and does not justify the overhead of writing and storing these files.
