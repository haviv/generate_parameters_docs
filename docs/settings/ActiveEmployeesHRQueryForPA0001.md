**Description:**

This parameter is used to configure the query for extracting active employee data from SAP HR module PA0001. It determines how active employee records are identified and extracted, focusing on ensuring that the connected systems have up-to-date and accurate employee information for compliance and security purposes.

Accurate and timely information on active employees is crucial for managing access rights, ensuring only authorized individuals have access to sensitive data and systems. Misconfiguration can lead to unauthorized access or denial of access to legitimate users, impacting compliance with internal and external regulations.

Proper configuration ensures the system can correctly identify active employees from the SAP HR module, streamlining user access management, compliance audits, and risk assessments by providing accurate data.

- Onboarding Process: Integrating new employees into the system, ensuring they are correctly marked as active and granted appropriate access rights from the start.
