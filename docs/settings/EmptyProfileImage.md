**Impact Level:** Low

**Description:** The Empty Profile Image parameter is utilized to specify or define the behavior or appearance for user profiles that do not contain an image. This is particularly relevant within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform's user management system.

**Business Impact:** A clear and professional appearance of user profiles on the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform can enhance user experience and interaction. Implementing a default or placeholder image for profiles without a specific user-uploaded image ensures consistency and aids in easy identification and management of user accounts.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When the Empty Profile Image parameter is configured, the system will display a default or placeholder image for users who have not uploaded a personal profile picture. This assists administrators and users in quickly identifying profiles and maintains a uniform interface aesthetic.

**Examples Scenario:** A company implements the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform for their governance, risk, and compliance management. To maintain a professional and uniform look across the user interface, they decide to configure the Empty Profile Image parameter so all employee profiles without uploaded pictures will display a default corporate logo or icon. This enhances the overall appearance of the application and supports brand consistency.
