# Enable Default Approver For Role Owner Steps

**Technical Name:** EnableDefaultApproverForRoleOwnerSteps

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter controls the assignment of a default approval group for steps involving role ownership responsibilities within workflows. It ensures that if a specific approval group has not been set, the system will default to the predefined approver associated with the role's business process.

**Business Impact:**

The absence of a default approver can lead to delays in the approval process, affecting the timely execution of tasks and overall workflow efficiency. Implementing a default approver streamlines the process, ensuring that there is always an approver available to take necessary actions, minimizing the risk of bottlenecks.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When enabled, this setting automatically assigns the predefined business process's workflow approval group as the default approver if no specific approver group has been designated for a role owner in the workflow steps.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Situation:** A user requests access to a particular system feature that requires approval based on their role.
- **Without the Setting:** The request might be delayed if the workflow step does not have a specified approver group, requiring manual intervention.
- **With the Setting Enabled:** The request is automatically forwarded to the default approval group assigned to the roleâ€™s business process, ensuring the request is processed in a timely manner.

**Related Settings:** 

- WorkflowApprovalGroupType

**Applicable Workflows Actions:** 

- WorkflowApprovalByRole

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** There is a clear hierarchy and structure in role ownership that allows for a default approval group to be appropriately assigned.
- **Avoid when:** Role owners or their business processes are too diverse, and a single default approver cannot effectively manage approval requests.
