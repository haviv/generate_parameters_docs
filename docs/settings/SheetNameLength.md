**Sheet Name Length**

**Technical Name:** SheetNameLength

**Category:** Reporting

**Default Value:** N/A

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**
This parameter specifies the maximum length of sheet names when exporting reports to Excel. It ensures that sheet names adhere to Excel's limitations and improves the readability and management of report outputs.

**Business Impact:**
Optimizing the Sheet Name Length can significantly affect the presentation and accessibility of exported reports. Reports with clearly named sheets are easier to navigate, reducing the time users spend searching for information. This can enhance decision-making processes by ensuring that critical data is readily accessible.

**Technical Impact when configured:**
When the Sheet Name Length parameter is configured, it ensures that the generated Excel reports do not exceed the maximum limit for sheet names imposed by Excel. This avoids errors during the report generation process and ensures that the exported reports are compatible with Excel's constraints.

**Examples Scenario:**

- **Scenario:** A user exports a compliance audit report with multiple sections each mapped to a separate sheet within a single Excel workbook. To maintain clarity and ensure compatibility, the Sheet Name Length parameter is configured to truncate or format sheet names according to predefined rules, ensuring they are both meaningful and within Excel's naming limitations.

**Related Settings:** N/A

**Best Practices:** 
- **Configure when:** you are generating reports that automatically name sheets based on dynamic content which might exceed Excel's naming limitations.
- **Avoid when:** sheet names are manually set and already comply with Excel's limitations.
