# Text For Inactive Workflow Approval Group

**Technical Name:** ImportManagersToWFApprovalGroupInactiveText

**Category:** Workflow Configuration

**Default Value:** Not Specified

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** This parameter is used to define custom text or messaging that is displayed for inactive workflow approval groups within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It allows organizations to customize the message that users see when an approval group is inactive, helping to clarify the workflow status and next steps.

**Business Impact:** The configuration of this parameter directly impacts user experience and understanding in workflow processes. By providing clear, custom messaging for inactive approval groups, organizations can reduce confusion, streamline workflow management, and improve overall compliance and governance practices. This enhances the organization's ability to manage risks associated with miscommunication or misunderstanding of workflow states.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When this parameter is configured, the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform will display the custom text for all inactive workflow approval groups. This customization can guide users on how to proceed, whom to contact, or the reason for the current inactive state, thereby aiding in better workflow management and compliance adherence.

**Examples Scenario:** If an approval group is marked as inactive due to an ongoing audit, the custom message configured through this parameter could inform users of the audit status and suggest alternative contacts or actions, thus preventing process deadlock and maintaining smooth operations.

**Related Settings:** Not Applicable

**Best Practices:** 
- **Configure when:** You have specific workflows or approval groups that frequently change state or require clear communication when inactive.
- **Avoid when:** Default messaging is sufficient for your organizationâ€™s workflow management needs or if the approval groups rarely become inactive, minimizing the need for custom messaging.
