**LogLevel**

**Technical Name:** LogLevel

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** Not Provided

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**
Configures the level of detail for logs generated by the system. Adjusting this setting can help in troubleshooting by providing more detailed logs or reduce the volume of logged information for standard operations.

**Business Impact:**
Proper configuration of the LogLevel parameter can aid in monitoring system health, identifying security threats, and debugging issues without overwhelming system resources. Misconfiguration might either result in insufficient data for effective troubleshooting or an excessive volume of logs, impacting storage and performance.

**Technical Impact when configured:**
- **Increased level:** Provides a detailed trace of operations, helping in the in-depth analysis and debugging of issues. Useful during system integration testing or after deploying new changes.
- **Decreased level:** Limits the recorded information to critical errors and warnings, reducing storage requirements and potentially improving system performance.

**Example Scenario:**
A financial institution uses the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to manage compliance. Post-upgrading their system, unexpected behavior is observed in transaction reports. The admin increases the LogLevel to capture detailed logs. This enables the IT team to quickly identify a misconfiguration in the reporting module and take corrective action.
