**Technical Name:** WorkflowCommentsButtonTextOverride

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Low

**Description:**

Allows customization of the text displayed on the button used to submit comments within workflow actions. This parameter is useful for organizations looking to tailor application language to fit business terminology or languages.

**Business Impact:**

Adjusting this parameter enables businesses to enhance user experience and clarity. It ensures that users find the application more intuitive, especially when standard terminology does not fit an organization's internal language or when operating in multi-lingual environments.

**Technical Impact: when configured**

Configuring this parameter changes the default text displayed on comments submission or interaction buttons within workflows, making the user interface more aligned with the organization's specific communication or operational standards.

**Examples Scenario:**

An organization operating in a non-English speaking country or with specific jargon might change the default "Submit Comment" text to a phrase that aligns more closely with its language or operational terminology, enhancing clarity and user engagement.

**Related Settings:**

- CommentsText
- NumberOfComments
- CommentLinkText

**Best Practices:** configure when the default language or terminology does not align with your organization's usual communication standards; avoid when default settings meet organizational needs and clarity.
