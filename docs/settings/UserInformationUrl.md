**Description:**

The UserInformationUrl parameter specifies the endpoint URL used to fetch detailed user information within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. It is utilized to integrate user data from external systems or databases, enriching the user's profile with additional details for a more comprehensive management and audit process.

**Business Impact:**

Proper configuration of the UserInformationUrl enhances security and compliance processes by ensuring that detailed, up-to-date user information is accessible. It supports informed decision-making in risk assessment, audit, and compliance reporting. By integrating external user data, organizations can apply governance policies more effectively across different systems.

**Examples Scenario:**

An enterprise has deployed Pathlock Cloud GRC to manage access controls and compliance across its SAP landscape. The organization maintains comprehensive employee profiles in an external HR system. By configuring UserInformationUrl to point to the HR system's API, Pathlock can retrieve and display detailed user profiles, aiding in more accurate SoD (Separation of Duties) analyses and audit reports.
