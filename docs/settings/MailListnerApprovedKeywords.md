# Mail Listener Approved Keywords

**Technical Name:** MailListnerApprovedKeywords

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** N/A

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** This parameter defines a list of approved keywords that the mail listener will use to process incoming emails, facilitating the initiation or update of workflow requests based on email content.

**Business Impact:** Proper configuration of this parameter ensures that only emails containing specific, approved keywords trigger workflow actions, reducing the risk of unauthorized or unintended workflows being executed. This enhances the security and efficiency of automated workflow processes, particularly in sensitive areas such as security requests or compliance reporting.

**Technical Impact when configured:** When configured, the Mail Listener filters incoming emails, acting on those that contain approved keywords by initiating or updating workflows. This allows for automated processing of tasks such as security alerts, compliance reports, or user access requests, directly from email content.

**Examples Scenario:** An organization has set up automated workflows for access requests. By configuring `MailListnerApprovedKeywords` with keywords like "Access Request", any incoming email containing this phrase can automatically trigger a workflow to assess and potentially grant access, streamlining the process.

**Related Settings:** N/A

**Best Practices:** configure when setting up automated email-based triggers for workflows to ensure security and efficiency; avoid when manual review of all incoming emails for workflow initiation is preferred to maintain tighter control.
