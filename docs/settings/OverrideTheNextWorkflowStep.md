# Override The Next Workflow Step

**Technical Name:** OverrideTheNextWorkflowStep

**Category:** Workflow

**Default Value:** False

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**

This parameter allows for the dynamic alteration of the designated next step in a workflow based on specific conditions met during the workflow execution. It enables skipping or overriding the predetermined sequence of workflow steps under certain circumstances, thereby introducing flexibility and conditional logic into the workflow's linear progression.

**Business Impact:**

Enabling this parameter can significantly enhance process efficiency by allowing for real-time adjustments to workflows based on situational conditions. This adaptability can lead to quicker decision-making and processing, reduced operational bottlenecks, and improved overall workflow performance. For businesses, this means enhanced adaptability to compliance requirements, risk management protocols, and operational demands.

**Technical Impact when configured:**

When configured, this parameter instructs the workflow engine to evaluate conditions at each step and determine whether the next predefined step should be executed or skipped. This can affect workflow duration, participant involvement, and the steps' execution order, ultimately impacting how quickly and effectively a workflow meets its objective.

**Example Scenario:**

Consider a scenario in a financial institution where a loan approval process is underway. Typically, the workflow involves multiple steps, including initial review, risk assessment, and final approval. By configuring the `OverrideTheNextWorkflowStep` parameter, the workflow can be dynamically adjusted to skip the risk assessment step for clients with a pre-established, exceptional credit history, thereby speeding up the approval process.

**Best Practices:** 

- **Configure when:** There's a clear understanding of the workflow and the conditions under which certain steps can be safely skipped without compromising the process's integrity or outcome.
  
- **Avoid when:** The workflow steps are mandatory for compliance or if skipping steps could lead to critical oversights or errors in the process.
