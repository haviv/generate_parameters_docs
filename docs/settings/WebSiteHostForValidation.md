**Web Site Host For Validation**

**Technical Name:** WebSiteHostForValidation

**Category:** Configuration

**Default Value:** `https://www.pathlock.com`

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:** The WebSiteHostForValidation parameter is used to define the host URL for the application that will be used in various validation processes within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform. This setting ensures that requests and redirections are only made to trusted URLs owned by the enterprise, improving security and preventing misuse.

**Business Impact:** By correctly configuring this parameter, organizations can avoid potential security vulnerabilities such as phishing attacks, redirection attacks, or unauthorized data access. It ensures that all platform-related communications, validations, and redirects are performed with known, trusted hosts, thus safeguarding sensitive information from exposure to untrusted sources.

**Technical Impact when configured:** Proper configuration of the WebSiteHostForValidation parameter reinforces the application's overall security posture by ensuring all validations and HTTP requests are performed against a verified and trusted host. Misconfiguration could lead to system vulnerabilities, allowing for phishing or redirection attacks that compromise data integrity and confidentiality.

**Examples Scenario:** 
- **Before Configuration**: Without configuring WebSiteHostForValidation, the platform might accept redirections or API calls from any source, posing significant security risks. 
- **After Configuration**: Setting WebSiteHostForValidation to "https://www.pathlock.com" ensures that only URLs matching this host will be accepted for web-based operations, effectively blocking attempts from unauthorized sources.

**Best Practices:** 
- **Configure when**: Setting up or reviewing security configurations within the Pathlock Cloud GRC platform to ensure secure and trusted web communications.
- **Avoid when**: The business does not own or control the specified host URL, as this can lead to failed validations and operational issues within the platform.
