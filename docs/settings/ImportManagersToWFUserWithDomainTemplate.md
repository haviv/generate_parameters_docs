# User with Domain Template for New Approver

**Technical Name:** ImportManagersToWFUserWithDomainTemplate

**Category:** Workflow Configuration

**Default Value:**

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Description:**
This parameter controls the behavior of importing managers as approvers into workflow systems. It specifies whether to generate a unique approval group for each manager found in directory services or active directory groups, based on specific import definitions.

**Business Impact:**
Applying this configuration effectively shapes the approval process, ensuring that managerial hierarchy is accurately reflected within operational workflows. It facilitates a more organized and streamlined approval mechanism, which is critical for maintaining compliance and operational efficiency.

**Technical Impact when configured:**
- Dynamically creates approval groups in the workflow system for each identified manager.
- Aids in aligning workflow approvals with organizational structure and management levels.
- Enhances the automation of compliance processes by ensuring accurate representation of managerial approval hierarchy.

**Example Scenario:**
An organization wants to automate its approval processes for access requests. By utilizing the ImportManagersToWFUserWithDomainTemplate parameter, they can ensure each manager has a dedicated approval group. This setup would be especially beneficial in scenarios where approval authority is strictly hierarchical, thereby speeding up the approval process and enhancing security by enforcing that requests are approved by the relevant managers.

**Related Settings:**
- ImportManagersToWFBuildOneGroupForEachApproval
- ImportManagersToWFIgnoreDepartmentTypes 

**Best Practices:** 
Configure this setting when:
- There's a clear hierarchical structure for approvals within your organization.
- Managers are responsible for approving specific types of requests or actions.

Avoid configuring this setting indiscriminately when:
- Your organization uses a flat structure for decision-making, and approvals can be handled by multiple roles, not strictly managers.
- The workflow does not benefit from having a detailed manager-level approval process, which could overcomplicate or slow down decision-making.
